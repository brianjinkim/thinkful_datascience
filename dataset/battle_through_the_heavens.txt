'Dou Zhi Li, 3rd stage!' Facing the Magical Testing Monument as it displayed the 5 big hurtful words, the youth stood expressionless, lips curled in a small self-ridiculing smile. He tightly clenched his fist and because of the strength used, his slightly sharp fingernails dug deep into the palm of his hand, bringing brief moments of pain. "Xiao Yan, Dou Zhi Li, 3rd stage! Rank: Low!" Beside the Magical Testing Monument, a middle-aged man looked at the results on the monument and announced them with an indifferent voice. Immediately after the middle-aged man finished speaking, without much surprise, the people in the square started a commotion, ridiculing him. "3rd stage? Hmmhmm, as expected. This 'genius' has once again taken a step back." "Ai, this piece of trash really disgraced his entire clan." "If his father wasn't the clan leader, this kind of trash would already have been kicked out of the clan. Nobody would care about him, and there wouldn't be such a thing as leeching off the clan home." "How could the once famous genius of Wu Tan Cheng fall to become like this over the past few years?" "Who knows? Maybe he did something unforgivable and caused the gods to get angry." The ridicule and laughter directed at him came from all directions and resonated in the motionless youth's ears, as if piercing his heart. He could not help but breathe heavily. He raised his head to reveal a delicate and immature face, jet black eyes glancing past the people of his age that ridiculed him as well. His lips, which were previously full of self-ridicule, turned to fill with bitterness instead. "These people, were they always this cold? Or was it because three years ago they smiled humbly to congratulate me, and now they wanted to take it back?" Smiling bitterly, Xiao Yan turned around and silently walked back to the group of people. His lonesome figure seemed to be unable to fit in with the surroundings. "Next up, Xiao Mei!" Hearing the tester's voice, a teenage girl quickly ran up from in the crowd. The moment she got on stage, the murmurings and discussions quietened down and every pair of fiery eyes were locked on her face. The teenage girl wasn't more than 14 years old. Although her beauty wasn't immediately evident, her small childish face combined with her innocence captured the attention of the audience. She quickly stepped forward and put her tiny hands on the black stone monument. She then closed her eyes gently. As the girl closed her eyes, the monument shined brightly once again. 'Dou Zhi Li, 7th stage!' "Xiao Mei, Dou Zhi Li, 7th stage! Rank: High!" "Yeh!" Hearing the tester read out the result, the teen girl smiled proudly. "Tsk tsk, 7th stage Dou Zhi Li. How impressive! At this rate, in three years she'll be named a true Dou Zhe already." "She really fits the name of the clan's seedling." Hearing the unanimous praise coming from the crowd, the girl's smile turned even wider. Vanity, the temptation that so many girls are unable to resist... While chatting with her fellow sister members, her line of sight weaved through the surrounding people and landed on a lonesome figure away from them. Furrowing her brows for a while, she finally decided against walking over. Between the two of them was already a huge gap. Looking at Xiao Yan's performance these past few years, by the time the Adulthood Ceremony comes, he would only be able to place at the lower tier clan member ranks. She, however, with her brilliance, would become the clan's very important and thus well-nurtured fighter. There would be no limit to her future. "Ai..." An inexplicable sigh emerged from her. Xiao Mei thought back to the youth from three years ago, bursting with energy and pride. At 4 he started practicing, and at 10 he achieved the 9th stage Dou Zhi Li. At 11 he broke the 10th stage Dou Zhi Li barrier and condensed his Dou Zhi Qi Zu successfully. He became the youngest Dou Zhe in the clan since the past 100 years. At that time, his self-confidence as well as immeasurable power attracted countless young teens which of course, included Xiao Mei. However, the path of a genius was always winding. Three years ago, this genius youngster whose fame reached the absolute top, received what could possibly be the cruelest blow. The hard work he put into accumulating and condensing the Dou Zhi Qi Zu over the past ten years had, in just one night, vanished into nothingness. All the Dou Zhi Li in his body slowly dissipated with time and instead, pity for him grew. As a result of losing his Dou Zhi Li, his physical strength decreased as well. From the position of a genius, in one night he fell below the average person. This kind of blow made the youth lose his will to carry on training. The reverence once associated with this lad had slowly changed into disdain and ridicule. Standing so high up, and falling right down – this kind of fall might just be one that he could never recover from. "Next, Xiao Xun Er!" Among the commotion, the tester's voice sounded yet again. Following the calling of this highly reputable name, the group of people quietened down immediately. Every single gaze turned. At the centerpoint of attention was a teen girl clad in a purple dress, elegantly standing there. Her calm, tender and immaculate face was completely unaffected by the many gazes of the crowd. Her calm and indifferent attitude could be compared to the blooming of a lotus. At such a young age, she already had the air of a refined lady. It would be hard to imagine how she would affect the city and the nation once she grew up. This purple dress girl, if compared to Xiao Mei in terms of beauty, was clearly several leagues above. It's no wonder the crowd would have this kind of actions. Taking small, graceful steps, the girl named Xiao Xun Er walked up in front of the stone monument. She stretched her small hand out and the purple sleeve mixed with black and gold threads fell down her arm, revealing a delicate snow-white wrist. She touched the monument lightly. In the silence, the monument shone once more. "Dou Zhi Li, 9th stage! Rank: High!" Looking at the words on the monument, the entire square fell into deep silence. "...... She really reached the 9th stage, how frightening! The position of the youngest high rank in the clan has been taken, without a shred of doubt, by Miss Xun Er!" After the silence, several teens couldn't help but wolf whistle, their eyes full of respect and awe. Dou Zhi Li was essential towards being a Dou Zhe. Dou Zhi Li is split into 10 different stages, and when the body acquires 10 stages of Dou Zhi Li, it can better condense the Dou Zhi vertex, becoming a well-respected Dou Zhe! In the crowd of people, Xiao Mei stared at the purple dress girl in front of the monument with a little jealousy. Looking at the results on the monument, the middle-aged tester who would normally be indifferent smiled, faced her and congratulated her: "Miss Xun Er, half a year later, you should be able to condense the Dou Qi vortex. If you succeed, you'll be a Dou Zhe at the age of 14, the second person to do so in the Xiao clan. Of course, the second person. First would be the fallen genius, Xiao Yan. "Thanks." The teen girl nodded her head lightly, her calm face showing a little happiness because of his praise. She quietly turned, and in the midst of the crowd's attention, slowly walked to the downtrodden youth in the back of the group. "Brother Xiao Yan." At the youth's side, the teen girl stopped. She faced Xiao Yan and bowed respectfully. Her beautiful and gentle face showed a elegant smile which would make the surrounding girls jealous. "What qualifications do I have right now for you to call me that?" He faced the girl that could be considered the clan's radiant pearl and said bitterly. She, after being down-hearted for an extremely short while, continued to maintain her respect. "Brother Xiao Yan, you once said to Xun Er before – to take on anything, one must first be able to let go. One is only truly free when he can take on and let go easily." Xiao Xun Er said gently, her smiling face full of warmth. "Haha, truly free? I only know how to say it. Look at me now, do I look like a free person? This world wasn't mine to begin with." Xiao Yan laughed at himself, saying dispiritedly. Facing Xiao Yan's somber mood, Xiao Xun Er's fine brows furrowed a little, and she said seriously: "Brother Xiao Yan, though I don't know what's happening to you, Xun Er honestly believes that you will stand again and reclaim your lost glory and respect..." She stopped for a moment, her white tender face reddening a little. "Back then, there were a lot of people who were attracted to you..." "Haha..." Hearing the girl's whole-hearted truth, he laughed awkwardly but didn't say anything else. Other people would be swayed by it, but he did not have the qualifications nor the mood. Instead, he silently turned around and walked away from the square. Standing still and facing the lonely back of the youth, she hesitated for a while before chasing after him and walking side-by-side with him. Meanwhile, from behind a jealous wolf whistle sounded(?). The moon was like a silver plate and the stars filled the sky. At the summit of the cliff, Xiao Yan lay on the grass and in his mouth was a strand of green grass. He chewed it slightly and let the bitterness spread into his mouth slowly. He raised his white palm and put it in front of him, blocking the moon and only letting some moonlight pass through the gaps between his fingers. He looked at the giant circular silver moon in the sky. "Ai..." Thinking back the testing in the afternoon, Xiao Yan sighed lightly. He lazily pulled his hand back and rested both hands on his head. He looked absent-minded. "15 years already, huh?" a soft voice that suddenly was spat out from the young teen without any warning. In Xiao Yan's mind, there was a secret that only he himself knew: He wasn't a person from this world. More accurately, his soul wasn't from this world. He was from a deep blue star called Earth. As for unexplainable mystery of why he would be here, he himself had no clue. However, after living here for some time, he slowly realised: He passed through to the other side! As he grew older, he slowly came to understand bits and pieces of this continent. This continent was called the Dou Qi Continent. On the continent, there wasn't many tales of magic users and their effects, but rather, Dou Qi was the main star. On this big piece of land, the training of Dou Qi had become commonplace after the hard work of countless individuals who continued to train beyond generations, expanding the knowledge surrounding Dou Qi all the way to the top. Dou Qi and mankind are one and the same in everyday life and as such, Dou Qi is extremely important in the continent. It could be called irreplaceable! As the number of levels in Dou Qi kept increasing, so did the number of ways to train it. Some were better than others, as expected. After going through a system of analysis, the Dou Qi rankings in the Dou Qi Continent got split into four different classes – Tian, Di, Xuan, Huang. And every class was split further into Beginner, Medium and High ranks! The Dou Qi techniques you learned also determined how strong you would be. For example, if a person practiced a Xuan class Medium rank technique, he would naturally be stronger than a person who practiced a Huang class High rank technique. In the Dou Qi Continent, to differentiate the strong from the weak, there are 3 criteria that need to be looked at. First, and also the most important, is your natural body strength. If a person only has a 1 star level of strength, even if he practiced the Tian class High rank techniques, he wouldn't be able to beat a Huang class Combat Master. Next is technique level. If two people of the same innate strength were to battle, the one with the better technique will obviously win. Lastly is Dou Technique. Dou Technique is a special kind of skill that is used when controlling Dou Qi and in the land of Dou Qi, Dou Technique is also separated into Tian, Di, Xuan, Huang. Dou Qi in the continent speaks for itself, but Dou Technique is different. Almost everyone starts off with a Dou Technique class of Huang. If you wanted to learn more advance control skills, you would need to join a sect or enroll in a Dou Technique school. Of course, there are some who, by chance, managed to learn the skills that others before have left behind, or those who have compatible Dou Techniques. For these people, their combat level might be slightly higher than normal. Relying on these 3 aspects, you can determine who is strong and who is weak. All in all, if you managed to learn a high level Dou Technique, the benefits in the future would be enormous. However, high level Dou Techniques are really hard to come by as a commoner. Those that are open to the public are normal, Huang class techniques. For those bigger clans or small sects, Xuan class techniques are the norm. For example, in Xiao Yan's clan, their highest level technique was only practiced by the clan leader – Lion Wind Strike. It was a wind style Xuan class Medium rank Dou Technique. Above the Xuan class would be the Di class, but this kind of high-level techniques might only obtainable by a powerful country-like organisation. As for the Tian class, in a hundred years, it hasn't appeared once. As previously stated, commoners trying to get a high-level technique is like trying to climb a mountain without gear. However, nothing is absolute. In the world of Dou Qi, there are thousands of clans. In the North, there are people referred to as 'Unbeatable'. They fused their soul with wild animals and became barbarians. In the South, there are smart and talented high class beast spirit clans, and even the strange and infamous underworld people. Because of the vastness of the continent, there are bound to be cases of nameless figures who, by chance, happened upon a miracle that made them strong. Or, perhaps, there might be people who are bound by fate to discover strong techniques. In the land of Dou Qi, there is one famous sentence: If you find yourself stuck in a ditch or forsaken by the world, don't panic. Take two steps forward and maybe you'll find yourself stronger than ever before. Of course, though this line isn't false, in the thousand years of history in the continent, there aren't many stories of people getting strong by random chance. As a result of this, every day, there are countless individuals who try to break through and discover a new skill or technique, but instead only return with a broken hip or leg. All in all, this continent is full of mysteries and miracles. To access the vault of secret Dou Qi techniques, you must at least be a full-fledged Dou Zhe to meet the basic requirements. For Xiao Yan, it seemed so far away. Puu Xiao Yan spat the grass out and quickly stood up and made a maniacal face. He faced the sky and shouted: "God damn it! How could I be played for a fool like this?" In his past life, Xiao Yan was a mediocre, average commoner. Wealth, fame and beauty seemed to run parallel to his life, never intersecting it. Then, when he came to this continent, Xiao Yan was shocked. Because of a second set of experiences, his spirit became much stronger than the average person. It must be known that in the Dou Qi continent, your spirit is decided upon at birth. Maybe, as you grew older, it would strengthen a slight bit, but there is no known technique to train your spirit to be stronger. It was Xiao Yan's strong spirit that gave him his talent, as well as his fame as a genius. For an average person, if they were told that they could be a genius, there's little doubt that they would claim their fame and live the high life. For the run-of-the-mill person like Xiao Yan, when he started training his Dou Zhi Qi, the temptation of being able to rise to fame would be unbearable. Of course he wouldn't choose to stay hidden and continue to train! If there wasn't any accident, Xiao Yan could perhaps grow even more with his 'genius' label. Unfortunately, at 11, his label was stolen from him and in one night, a genius turned into a piece of trash. After shouting at the top of his lungs for a while, Xiao Yan finally calmed down and his face turned calm again. No matter how angry he got, he wouldn't be able to get his strength back. Bitterly shaking his head, Xiao Yan felt miserable. He had no clue what happened to his body, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. His spirit was growing as he aged, as expected. His absorbtion of Dou Zhi Qi was also extraordinarly fast. It was faster than the strongest fighter from a few years back. All these factors should have meant that Xiao Yan was a natural genius, but all the Dou Zhi Qi that he absorbed seemed to be completely gone. His self-esteem took a big hit and he could only feel depressed. Taking another deep breath, Xiao Yan raised his hand. On his finger was a black ring of simple design. The material used to make it was unknown. On it were some markings as well. This was the only present his late mother gave to him before she passed. He started wearing it since the age of 4 and even now, 10 years later, he was still wearing. It was a precious gift from his mother and Xiao Yan treasured it dearly. He rubbed the ring and said bitterly: "These few years, I've really let Mother down, huh?" Sighing deeply, Xiao Yan quickly stood up and turned around, saying to the black figure from the woods: "Father, why have you come?" Though his Dou Zhi Qi was only 3rd stage, his spiritual awareness was akin to that of a 5 star Dou Zhe, perhaps even better. While thinking about his mother, he felt a sudden disturbance from the woods. "Ah ah, Yan Er. It's already quite late. Why are you still here?" From within the cluster of trees, after a moment of silence, a tender voice sounded. The trees shaked a little and a middle-aged man jumped out, face smiling widely. His eyes were locked on his son under the moonlight. The middle-aged man was wearing an expensive looking grey tunic. He walked with pride and dignity and his face showed it. He was the Xiao clan leader, as well as Xiao Yan's father, a 5 star Dou Shi – Xiao Zhan! "Father, why have you not returned to rest yet?" Facing the middle-aged man, Xiao Yan's smiled thickened. Although he had another set of memories, when he was born, the person before him treated him as with love and care. When he lost his power and spirit, the love did not lessen but grew instead. This poked at Xiao Yan's heart, making Xiao Yan recognise him as his father. "Yan Er, are you still thinking about what happened this afternoon?" Taking a big step forward, Xiao Zhan smiled again. "Ha ha, what's there to think about? It's within my expectations." Xiao Yan shaked his head and forced a smile. "Ai..." Looking at Xiao Yan's tender face, Xiao Zhan let out a sigh. The both of them sinked into silence for a while, before Xiao Zhan said: "Yan Er, you're 15 now, aren't you?" "Yes, father." "Just one more year... and you have to attend the Adulthood Ceremony..." Xiao Zhan said. "Yes, father. Only a year left." Xiao Yan's fist clenched for a while before he replied. He was extremely clear what the Adulthood Ceremony meant. Once the ceremony had past, for the Xiao Yan that didn't train, he would be subject to the criteria of searching for Dou Qi techniques. Because he was so weak, he would be sent to do a normal job in the other parts of the Xiao clan. This was a clan rule and even if the clan leader was his father, he would not be able to do anything about it. If one didn't reach Dou Zhe by the age of 25, the clan would abadon them. "Sorry, Yan Er. If you don't reach the Dou Zhi Qi 7th stage by next year, I can't do anything to help you, no matter how much I want to. In this clan, I'm not the sole decision maker. There's also those old geezers waiting for me to make a mistake..." Looking at the peaceful Xiao Yan, Xiao Zhan voiced guiltily. "Father, I will continue to work hard. One year later, I'll definitely reach the Dou Zhi Qi 7th stage!" Xiao Yan reassured his father. "4 stages in 1 year? Ahh... if it were me from before, it may have been possible, but now... I might not have much of a chance..." Though Xiao Yan was trying to reassure his father, he himself was bitter about it. Knowing full well Xiao Yan's position, Xiao Zhan could only answer with a sigh. He knew that 4 stages of Dou Zhi Qi in a year was extremely difficult. He gently patted Xiao Yan's head, and smiled, saying: "It's getting quite late, you should go back and get some rest. Tomorrow, the clan has a guest and you shouldn't miss the ceremony." "Guest? Who?" Xiao Yan asked, full of curiousity. "You'll find out tomorrow." Xiao Zhan winked at the restless Xiao Yan, leaving with a big smile on his face. "Don't you worry, father. I'll work really hard." Xiao Yan rubbed the simple ring while raising his head and whispering. Just when Xiao Yan raised his head, the black ring on his finger sudddenly lit up with a mysterious glow and flashed. Blinking, Xiao Yan realised it wasn't a person... A young man was meditating on his bed. In front of him, his hands were clasped in a weird yet relaxed manner. His chest peacefully rose and fell with the rhythm of his breath. Everything was just... so natural! With every breath he took, a pale white stream of what seemed to be air darted into the young man's nose and mouth, squeezing into his body and reshaping it. As the young man was meditating, a strange yet dim sparkle appeared for a brief moment on the plain black ring that he wore on his finger ... "Huuuu..." The young man slowly let out his breath and opened his eyes, blinking. A pale white light flashed across his black pupils, that was the Dou Qi that had just been absorbed but not yet completely refined. "It took such great effort to get that Dou Qi, but... f*ck, it's disappearing again! No, no please noooo..." The young man tried desperately to keep the disappearing Dou Qi from slipping away but to no avail. As the last sliver of Dou Qi left his body, the young man's face changed from being calm to one of anger and despair and his voice rose with fury. He curled his hands into fists and was rapidly clenching and unclenching them. Eventually, his visage transited from extreme anger to a forced grin. After all, there was nothing he could do about it. Wearily, he dragged his body off the bed and stretched his numb legs. With only Dou Qi of a 3rd Stage, such menial matters were always present. After having done a few exercises in his plain room, an old, wizened voiced sounded outside of his door: "Young master, the clan leader has requested your presence in the hall." The young man was the third son of the clan header, Xiao Yan. Above him were two brothers, but they had already left the clan in search of adventure. Only at the end of each year would they come back and meet their family. Overall however, the two brothers were extremely nice to their little brother, Xiao Yan, even when he fell from being a genius to a piece of trash. "Coming!" Xiao Yan changed his clothes and went out. Outside of his room was an elder in a green robe. "Let's go!" Looking at the young man's fresh face, the elder nodded his head. But when he turned around, his eyes showed a flash of regret.If young master had his former talent, he probably would have been a great Dou Zhe, such a waste... The elder and the young man crossed through the back yard and finally arrived solemnly at the welcoming hall. After politely knocking, the two softly went in. The hall was quite large, but there were many people already in it. At the head of the hall were Xiao Zhan and three emotionless elders. They were the clan elders and had equal importance to the Clan leader. On the left, below the four were other elders from the clan. These elders didn't hold as much power as the clan elders but nevertheless, they had quite a bit of say and weren't pushovers. Besides these elders were young men that had shown promise and talent. On the other side was three strangers, looks like they were the people that Xiao Zhan foretold last night. The young man's eyes quickly swept through the strangers. Of the three, there was an elder wearing a moon white outfit. Although the elder was all smiles, his tiny eyes were full of energy, restlessly scanning the room. Xiao Yan's sight dipped lower, stopping at the elder's chest. On his chest was a silver moon and besides the moon were seven shiny stars. 7 Star Da Dou Shi! This guy's a 7 star Da Dou Shi? Incredible. Xiao Yao could barely refrain from gasping at the elder. The elder was stronger than his own father, in fact, he was two whole stars stronger. Anyone that became a Da Dou Shi was at least a power to be reckoned with. With that kind of strength, most places would probably rush for recruitment. To be able to see such a powerful person, it's not surprising that Xiao Yan was shocked. Beside the elder were a young couple. They were also wearing moon white robes. The male was about 20 years old and had a handsome face, coupled with a strong build. He was definitely the ideal type for any girl. Of course, the most important thing was, on his chest were 5 golden stars. This represented the strength of the young man: 5 star Dou Zhe! To be able to become a 5 star Dou Zhe at the age of 20 definitely shows the exceptional talent of the young man. With a handsome face and decent strength, this young man, not only became the target of stares from young girls in the clan, even Xiao Mei occasionally sent glances to him. But, the looks that the girls gave had no effect on the young man. His entire focus was concentrated on the young girl beside him... The young girl's age was similar to Xiao Yan which made Xiao Yan flinch. Her beauty even rivaled Xiao Mei's, no, she was prettier than Xiao Mei. In the entire clan, probably only Xiao Xun Er could rival her. No wonder the guys of Xiao clan chased girls outside of the clan. On the intricate ear of the young girl was a green jade earrings. As she moved around, the pieces of jade clinked together, chirping a beautiful melody and adding a hint of royalty to the girl... In addition, on the developing chest of the girl were 3 golden stars. A 3-Star Dou Zhe, This girl... if she didn't use any special methods, she must be an incredible genius! Xiao Yao's heart fell, she had talent rivalling his former talent! But Xiao Yao forced his eyes away from the cold beauty. No matter what, beneath Xiao Yao's immature appearance was a mature soul. Although the girl was very pretty, he kept himself from acting like a drooling slob. Xiao Yan's actions caused a slight tension within the girl. Although she wasn't the kind that had an entire universe revolving around her, her beauty and appearance wasn't bad. Xiao Yan's random glance over her was a first for her. "Father, three elders!" Walking quickly, Xiao Yan courteously greeted the Xiao Zhan and the three elders. "Haha, Yan Er, you came! Here, come sit." Seeing Xiao Yan arrival, Xiao Zhan stopped talking to his guests and nodded in the direction of Xiao Yan, waving his hand to indicate for Xiao Yan to take a seat. With a slight smile, Xiao Yan ignored the lazy, almost hateful gazes from the three clan elders and searched for his seat. But, he was surprised at the result, he didn't have a seat... Hahhh, my position in the clan is just sinking lower and lower. It was better before, but now, they even embarrass me in front of guests, these old geezers... Xiao Yao ridiculed himself silently, in his mind, he shook his head as if it could block the emotions that welled up within him. Looking at the motionless Xiao Yan, the young clan members let out soft, mocking laughter, showing their happiness at seeing Xiao Yan be made a fool. Finally, Xiao Zhan realized Xiao Yan's predicament. A look of anger flashed across his face before being replaced with a bent eyebrow: "Second elder, you..." "Ohh, really sorry. I can't believe that I forgot about young master. Hehe, I'll go get someone to prepare a chair!" The yellow robed elder smiled at the staring Xiao Zhan. He patted his forehead in an act of self-criticism but the belittling look in his eyes didn't fade. "Brother Xiao Yan, come sit here!" The clear voice of a girl rang across the hall. The three elders tensed, their gaze shifting to Xun Er in the corner. Their mouths twitched but none of them said anything... In the corner, Xiao Xun Er closed the thick book in her lap, and blinked at Xiao Yan. Looking at Xiao Xun Er's smiling face, Xiao Yan froze for a second. Quickly, he recovered and after touching his nose, he walked towards Xun Er under the envious gazes of the surrounding clan members and after what seemed like the longest few seconds, he plopped next to Xun Er. Xiao Yan whispered: "Thanks, you've rescued me again." Xiao Xun Er lightly smiled, two small dimples appearing on her face. Her slender fingers flipped open the book in front of her. Even though she was extremely young, there was an air of intellectuality around her. After scanning through the page, Xun Er suddenly complained: "Brother Xiao Yan, you haven't sat beside me, alone, for three years now, right?" "Uhh...you're a genius in the clan, isn't it simple for you if you want friends?" Looking at the resentful face of Xun Er, Xiao Yan drily laughed. "But the thing is, a certain someone snuck into my room every night when I was 4 to 6. And then that certain someone used a clumsy technique and weak Dou Zi Qi to strengthen my bones and meridians. Every time, the same person would get himself sweating profusely before leaving. Brother Xiao Yan, do you know who he is?" Xun Er paused for a moment and suddenly tilted her head, and smiled towards Xiao Yan. "Uhh... how, how am I supposed to know? I was so young back then, in fact, I could barely walk, how would I know?" Xiao Yan's heart began to beat violently. Forcing open a smile, Xiao Yan guilty turned his gaze to the center of the hall. "Hehe..." Looking at Xiao Yan's reaction, a slight smile floated on Xiao Xun Er's face. Her sight moved back to the book on her lap and as if talking to herself, she said: "Even though I know that, that person did it in goodwill, I'm a girl right? How can I let someone carelessly touch me? If I ever find out who did it, hmph..." Xiao Yan's mouth began to twitch violently, keeping his sight straight, he shut his mouth tight... In the main hall, Xiao Zhan and the three clan elders were talking excitedly with the strange elder. The guest seemed to have something weighing on his mind, yet every time when it seemed as if he was about to broach the subject, he would swallow back the words and change the topic. Each time he did this, the delicate girl next to him would give the elder a subtle yet firm glance... After listening on to their conversation for a while, Xiao Yan was bored by their conversation and his head was slowly drooping... "Brother Xiao Yan, do you know who they are?" Right when Xiao Yan was about to fall asleep from boredom, Xun Er who was beside him opened her ancient book and asked Xiao Yan. "Do you know?" Xiao Yan curiously looked at Xun Er. "Did you see the symbol of a silver sword with the clouds on the cuff of their robes?" Xun Er said with a light smile. "Oh?" Xiao Yan looked towards the cuffs of the three and indeed, there he clearly saw the embroidered symbol of a sword sparkling in the clouds! "They are from the Faction of Misty Clouds?" Xiao Yan asked in bewilderment. Even though Xiao Yan had never gone out into the real world, he had read from books about this faction. Xiao Yan's clan lived in a city named Wu Tan City which was part of the Jia Ma Empire. Even though this city is listed as being one of the bigger cities within Jia Ma Empire, it was still dwarfed by the size of the empire, despite having the Magic Monsters Mountain Range behind it. Within the city itself, Xiao Yan's clan was the biggest. Besides the Xiao Clan, there were two other clans that competed with the Xiao Clan, but even after 24 years of blood and strife, they were unable to overtake the Xiao clan... If the Xiao Clan was the strongest power in Wu Tan City, then the Faction of Misty Clouds would be the strongest power in the entire Jia Ma Empire! The difference between the Xiao Clan and the Faction of Misty Clouds was enormous, to the point where Xiao Yan's father Xiao Zhan, who normally kept a strict and harsh face, was extremely respectful in front of these guests. "Why are they here?" Xiao Yan whispered. Xun Er's slim fingers paused, "Maybe it's related to you, Brother Xiao Yan ..." "Me? But I don't have any relationship with them!?" Hearing Xun Er's response, Xiao Yan paused before shaking his head and whispering back. "Do you know the name of the girl up there?" Xun Er glanced at the girl. "No, do you?" Xian Yan furrowed his brows as he examined the face of the girl Xun Er pointed out. He cannot recall ever having seen her before. "She's Nalan Yanran!" A curious expression floated on Xun Er's face. Xiao Yan stiffened, "Nalan Yanran? The granddaughter of Nalan Jie, the Lionheart commander of Jia Ma Empire? She's... she's my fiancée that was set between our families, before I was born?" "Hehe, grandfather and Nalan Jie were like blood brothers and at that time, you and Nalan Yanran were born around the same time, so the two decided that you guys would get married. But, unfortunately, three years after you were born, grandfather died in a fight with a clan enemy and as time passed, Xiao Clan's relation with the Nalan family became weaker..." Xun Er paused and looked at Xiao Yan who was absorbed in Xun Er's story, "Nalan Jie is not only arrogant, he also puts extreme emphasis on promises. The marriage was decided by him so even though your name has been quite bad the past few years, he has never once thought of annulling the marriage..." "That geezer sure is quite obstinate..." Xiao Yan smiled. "Nalan Jie has the final say in all matters within the family so even though he really is very fond of his granddaughter, no one in the family has stepped up to oppose the marriage..." Xun Er's beautiful eyes lightly glanced at Xiao Yan before continuing, "But 5 years ago, Nalan Yanran became a student under the faction leader of Misty Clouds. In these 5 years, Nalan Yanran demonstrated incredible talent. When a person has enough power to change the path of their life, they would try their hardest to change things that they don't like and unfortunately, she absolutely hates her promised marriage with brother Xiao Yan!" "You're saying... that she came to CANCEL the marriage?" Xiao Yan's face darkened. At this moment he was furious, not because Nalan Yanran did not want him as her husband but rather, because Nalan Yanran is trying to cancel the marriage with the entire clan present! If that happens then his father would lose much of his dignity and respect within the clan! Xiao Yan slowly breathed in, the cold air calming his raging thoughts. Within his sleeve, Xiao Yan curled his fist, thinking, if I was a Dou Shi, who would dare to trample over my dignity? It was true, if Xiao Yan was a Dou Shi, then, even if Nalan Yanran had the backing of the Faction of Misty Clouds, she would not be able to do such a thing. A 15 year old Dou Shi,,there were only a few that had such high accomplishments in the entire history of Dou Qi Mainland. And the few people that were at that level when they were that young are now some of the most influential people in the entire Dou Qi world. A small fragile hand cleverly evaded Xiao Yan's sleeves and held onto Xiao Yan's hands. Xun Er softly said, "Brother Xiao Yan, if she really cancels the marriage, then that's her own loss. I believe that in a couple of years, she will be regretting her decisions today!" "Regret?" Xiao Yan sneered. "With my current abilities, I don't have that kind of luxury." Xiao Yan paused before changing the tone of his voice, "Wait, Xun Er. How are you so familiar with them? The things that you've just said, my father might not even know some of them. How do you know all these?" Xun Er stiffened but did not say anything. Looking at Xue Er's avoidance on the subject, Xiao Yan could only helplessly smile. Even though Xun Er was also part of the Xiao family, she and Xiao Yan didn't have any relation by blood. In addition, Xiao Yan had never seen Xun Er's parents and every time he asked his father about them, Xiao Zhan would shake his head and not speak. Soon, Xun Er's parents became a taboo subject, something that they seemed to fear speaking about. For Xiao Yan, Xun Er's identity was always veiled in mystery. No matter how hard or how cleverly he tried, Xun Er would always stay silent. "Ugh, whatever, if you don't want to say it then don't." Shaking his head, Xiao Yan's face suddenly darkened again. The guest elder, under the repeated signals from Nalan Yanran, finally stood up... "Heh, using the Faction of Misty Clouds to pressure father? This Nalan Yanran certainly is using some shameless tactics..." Fury began to build within Xiao Yan's heart. "Ahem." The white robed elder cleared his throat and stood up. Putting his hands together, he smiled: "Clan leader Xiao Zhan. The reason we came here for today is because we would like your help for something." "Of course, Ge Ye, if you have any problems just let me know. If I can help you solve it, then I definitely wouldn't dare say no." To the visiting elder, Xiao Zhan did not refuse but since he did not know what the request was, he did not make any promises either. "Hehe, Leader Xiao, do you know her?" Ge Ye smiled lightly and pointed to the girl next to him. "Umm... I'm sorry, this girl is..." Xiao Zhan looked over the girl and awkwardly shook his head. When Nalan Yanran became Yun Jun's student, she was only 8. After studying in the Faction of Misty Clouds for 5 years, she had changed quite a lot. Before she was only a child but now she is a blooming teenager! "Huh...Her name is Nalan Yanran." "Uncle Xiao, I haven't come to pay my respect in a long time. It's my fault that you don't recognize me." Nalan Yanran sweetly said. "Hehe, Yanran, I heard that you've become a student under Yun Jun. At the time, I thought that it was just a baseless rumour, but now I realize that it's actually true. What incredible talent you must have..." Xiao Zhan complimented. "It was just good luck..." Smiling lightly, Nalan Yanran began to feel uncomfortable and lightly tugged Ge Ye's robe with her hand under the table. "Hehe, Leader Xiao, the request that I have relates to Yanran. In addition, this was assigned by our faction leader..." Ge Ye kept his smile but when he mentioned the faction leader, he subconsciously lessened his smile and his face grew serious. Like Ge Ye, Xiao Zhan stopped smiling. The faction leader of the Faction of Misty Clouds was one of the most important people in the entire Jia Ma Empire. Xiao Zhan, who was a small clan leader, wouldn't dare to provoke her. But with her power, what would she need Xiao Clan to help with? Ge Ye did say that it was related to Yanran, is it that? A wandering thought crossed Xiao Zhan's mind causing the edge of his mouth to twitch slightly and his firm hand to start trembling, thankfully his hands were covered by his long sleeves. Taking care to push down the thought, Xiao Zhan shakily asked: "Mister Ge Ye, please do tell me what is the faction's request?" "Errr..." Ge Ye hesitated but he thought about how much the faction leader adored Yanran and thus, he clenched his teeth: "Leader Xiao, you know how strict the rules are in the faction. In addition, faction leader views Yanran very highly, in fact, faction leader is expecting Yanran to be the next faction leader. However, due to a special rule, future faction leaders cannot have a relation with another male before they become the official faction leader..." Taking a breath, Ge Ye continued: "When our faction leader asked Yanran about it, she realized that Yanran and the Xiao Clan had a marriage proposal, therefore, faction leader asks for Leader Xiao to... to cancel this marriage." "KA!" The jade cup in Xiao Zhan's hands turned into a fine mist in an instant. In the main hall, everyone was silent. The three clan elders were shocked by Ge Ye's words but soon afterwards, the elders glanced at Xiao Zhan with plain glee and ridicule. "Hehe, how will you respond to this?" The three elders thought sinisterly. A couple of the younger kids didn't know about the set marriage between Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran, but after asking their parents about it, their faces brightened! Their glances towards Xiao Yan were full of ridicule and distaste... Looking at Xiao Zhan's dark face, Nalan Yanran lowered her head and squeezed her fingers together. "Leader Xiao, I know that this request is a little over the top, but because faction leader requested it, please cancel the marriage..." Helplessly letting out a breath, Ge Ye lightly whispered to Xiao Zhan. Xiao Zhan's hands curled into fists. A faint green Dou Qi slowly creeped over his body and finally, it formed a illusory lion's head in front of Xiao Zhan's face. Xiao Clan's secret Qi Method: Furious Lion's Rage! Level: Middle Xuan! Looking at Xiao Zhan's reaction, Ge Ye's face became serious. He moved to place Yanran behind him and within his eagle claw like hands a green Dou Qi gathered. The Dou Qi released small but sharp illusory swords. Faction of Misty Cloud's Qi Method: Green Wood Sword! Level: Low Xuan! With the release of Dou Qi, the weaker youngsters within the main hall became pale and felt their chests tighten. When Xiao Zhan's breathing became more intense, the three elders yelled out! Their voices were like lightning that swept through the hall: "Xiao Zhan, STOP! Don't forget, you're the clan leader of Xiao Clan!" Xiao Zhan stiffened and the Dou Qi on his body disappeared slowly... Xiao Zhan fell back into his chair and emotionlessly watched the lowered head of Yanran. Finally, he said is a raspy tone: "Nalan, you have some guts. With such a daughter, I'm really envious of Nalan Su." Nalan Yanran twitched: "Uncle Xiao..." "No! Call me Clan Leader Xiao from now on. I don't deserve to be called Uncle; you're the future faction leader of the Faction of Misty Clouds. In the future, you'll probably one of the most important people in Dou Qi mainland. My Xiao Yan only has modest talent, he doesn't deserve you..." "Thank you Clan Leader Xiao." Hearing Xiao Zhan's words, Ge Ye's face brightened. Apologizing, he says: "Clan Leader Xiao, faction leader understands that today's request is quite disrespectful. Therefore, she asked me to bring something, please accept it as an apology from our faction leader." Ge Ye touched a ring on his hand and suddenly a completely pan-green jade box appeared in his hand... Carefully opening the box, a fragrance swept through the entire main hall. Anyone who smelled it felt relaxed. The three elders' curiosity got the better of them and they poked their head to see the contents of the box: "Qi Gathering Powder?" Within the jade box, a green pill, about the size of a Dragon's eye, laid quietly. The refreshing scent that had spread throughout the entire hall was emanating from the pill! In Dou Qi Mainland, to become a Dou Zhe, one needs to be able to compress the Qi within one's own body to a Qi cyclone. But the process of compressing Qi to become a Qi cyclone has an extremely high failure rate. After failing, one's 9 Duan Qi would fall back to 8 Duan. Some unlucky people need to compress their Qi 10 or more times before they are successful in doing so. But by wasting so much time on the compression of Qi, one would lose the best time to practice Qi and thus destroy their future. Qi Gathering Power, its use was to allow someone with 9 Duan Qi to have a 100% percent success rate when trying to compress one's Qi! This effect makes many people red-eyed. After all, anyone thats not a Dou Zhe is treated extremely badly. But Qi Gathering Power isn't something made by nature, rather it was made by someone: Alchemist! In Dou Qi Mainland, the sole profession that's more desirable than a Dou Zhe are Alchemists. Like the name suggests, alchemists are able to create special pills that raise one's strengths. Every free-agent alchemist is sought after by many forces. The reason as to why alchemists have such a high position is because of how rare alchemists are and how strict the requirements to become an alchemist are. First of all, one must be of the fire attribute. And then, within the fire attribute, one must have a tiny sliver of the wood attribute to act as a catalysis in pill-refining. In the Dou Qi Mainland, a person's attribute is determined by their soul. A soul since birth will only have one, sole attribute and reject any other attribute. So its impossible for a person to have two attributes. Of course, nothing is impossible. Within a million people, there will always be someone who has a mutated soul. Within these people that have mutated souls, some have the potential to become Alchemists! However, a person that has the fire and wood attributes is not enough to become an Alchemist. That's because one must also have a strong Soul Perception or Soul Moulding! In the refinement of pills, the three most important requirements are: The material, the flame and one's soul perception. The Material. They would have to be natural treasures. After all, even the best alchemists can't create a god-tier pill from trash material. Therefore, good base materials are very important for good pills. The flame. Or the fire that's required when refining pills. The fire used in refining pills can't be normal flames but rather, they must be Dou Qi flames created though Dou Qi with a fire attribute. Of course, there are some extremely strong mutated flames in nature. Some strong alchemists would take these flames and use them to refine pills instead of their own Dou Qi flame. Not only do these mutated flames boost the success rate of the refinement, they also increase the effectiveness of the pills! Because refining pills is a gruesome task, extended periods of refinement requires a lot of Dou Qi, and because of that, every brilliant alchemist is also a strong fire-type Dou Zhe. The final requirement is Soul Perception. When refining a pill, the intensity of the flame needs to be controlled with ridiculous precision. If the flame is slightly too hot, the pill within the furnace would be burned to ashes, wasting the time and effort of the alchemist. Therefore, controlling the intensity of the flame is a prerequisite to becoming an alchemist. But in order to have a control over the flames, one must have an incredible Soul Perception; without Soul Perception, even if one meets or even exceeds the first two requirements, it would be pointless to try to refine pills. Under these strict conditions, the ones who have the qualifications to become an alchemist are few and rare. Because there aren't that many alchemists, the magical pills that they refine are also few and sparse. Since rare things are valuable and pills can definitely be defined as rare, alchemists all have a honorable, to an exaggerated extent, position. Within the main hall, with the gasps of the three elders, the younger generation all stare at the Jade box in Ge Ye's hands. Next to her father, Xiao Mei licks her red lips with her soft tongue and stares at the box, without blinking... "Hehe, this was refined by our honorable elder Gu He. I think that everyone here has heard of his name right?" Looking at the embarrassing appearance of the three elders, Ge Ye started becoming arrogant. "This pill was refined by the Pill King Gu He?" Hearing Ge Ye's words, the three elders once again embarrassed themselves. Pill King Gu He, an extremely influential alchemist within the Jia Ma Empire. His alchemy is mysterious and unpredictable, causing countless different forces to try to fawn upon him. Not only does Gu He have extraordinary talent in alchemy, his own strength is at the level of a Dou Wang and he's one of the top ten Dou Zhes in Jia Ma Empire. Refined by his hands, the Qi Gathering Powder's value is probably exponentially higher than other normal Qi Gathering Power. The three elders smile at the Qi Gathering Powder within the Jade box. If the Xiao Clan gets this Qi Gathering Powder, then the Xiao Clan can probably develop another young Dou Zhe. Right when the three elders were thinking about how to get the pill for their own grandsons, a young voice filled with fury resonates within the main hall. "Mr. Ge Ye, it would be better if you kept the pill. Your request, we might not accept it!" The main hall fell silent and everyone's gaze turns upon the delicate face of Xiao Yan in the corner. "Xiao Yan, you don't have the right to say anything right now. Be quiet!" One of the elder's face became dark as he yells at Xiao Yan. "Xiao Yao, be quiet. I know that you're not happy about this but we'll decide what will happen!" Another quite old elder said to Xiao Yan. "Three elders, if your sons or grandsons had their marriage released today, would you still be saying that?" Xiao Yao slowly stands up. The edge of his mouth was curved upwards in ridicule. Since it was apparent that the three elders treated him with disdain, why should he be so respectful to them? "You..." Hearing Xiao Yan's words, the three elders couldn't find a way to argue against his words. The grumpy third elder even started materializing his Dou Qi in anger. "Three elders, Xiao Yao ge-ge isn't wrong. He's the victim of this so you guys shouldn't decide for him." A clear girl's voice rang across the main hall. Hearing the girl's voice, the three elders' arrogance fell and after exchanging worried glances, they all nodded and sat back down. Looking at the three elders backing off, Xiao Yao turns his head back and deeply gazes at the smiling Xiao Xun Er. Who are you? To be able to make the three elder fear you... Pressing down his confusion, Xiao Yao quickly walks up and respectfully bows to his father, Xiao Zhan. Afterwards, he turns around to face Nalan Yanran. Slowly letting a breath of air, he asks: "Lady Nalan, I would like to ask a question. Your visit here today, to release the marriage, did Grandfather Nalan give his consent?" Before, when Xiao Yan came out from his corner, Nalan Yanran already felt uncomfortable with him. Now hearing his question, her brow scrunches up. This guy, at first I thought he was pretty nice, but he's actually extremely shameless. Does he not know the difference between the two of us? Criticizing Xiao Yan in her mind, Nalan Yanran never considered how releasing the marriage would put Xiao Yan and his father into an awkward and infuriating situation. Standing up and staring at the should be husband of hers, Nalan Yanran says: "Grandfather didn't give his consent. But! This is my own problem and not related to him." "Since Grandfather hasn't said anything then I hope that you will forgive my father for not accepting your request. Our marriage was set by our two grandfathers and since none of them have said to release the marriage then this marriage will go on. Or else, the people that are trying to release the marriage would be disrespecting their ancestors! I think, that within our clan, there aren't any people that would do such a dishonorable thing." Xiao Yan tilts his head and stares straight at the three elders. Using the dishonorable title, Xiao Yan forced the elders to be silent. In the strict clan, doing something as blasphemous as disrespecting one's ancestors would be enough for them to lose their spot as an elder of the clan. "You..." After being rebuffed by Xiao Yan, Nalan Yanran couldn't find any argument to retort Xiao Yan's claim. Her face became ashen and heavily stomping her feet, her princess nature became apparent. Looking at the young man with disgust, she annoyingly says: "Under what conditions will you release the marriage? Were the reparations too little? Alright, I can ask my teacher to give you another 3 Qi Gathering Powder. In addition, if you want to, I can let you join Faction of Misty Clouds and learn profound Dou Qi training methods, is that enough?" Hearing the attractive conditions from Nalan Yanran, the three elders' breathing started to become heavy. Within the main hall, the younger generation swallowed the saliva. Joining Faction of Misty Clouds? God, that's the dream of countless people... After saying all these conditions, Nalan Yanran raised her snow-white chin, like a princess addressing her servants. She waited for Xiao Yan's response and knew that these conditions were enough to make any young man crazy... Unlike what Nalan Yanran expected, after saying the alluring condition, the young man in front of her started trembling. He slowly raised his head and his delicate and young face was contorted into a fearsome, savage face. Even though Xiao Yan had endured countless taunts over the past three years, even he had a limit. Nalan Yanran's actions had roughly stepped on the final shred of dignity hidden deep within Xiao Yan's heart. "Ahh..." Seeing the vicious face of the young man, Yanran sprang backwards. The young man by her sides took the chance to pull out his sword and coldly stared at Xiao Yan. "I...I want to kill you!" Even though his teeth were clattering, Xiao Yan's words had an unmistakable killing intent to them! His hands were curled into fists and within the his black pupils, furious flames burned.  "Yan Er, you're being rude!" At the top of the hall, Xiao Zhan was shocked by the reaction of Xiao Yan and hurriedly quieted Xiao Yan. The current Xiao clan wouldn't dare be on the wrong side of Faction of Misty Clouds.  Even though his fists tightened even further, Xiao Yan lowered his head. Moments later, he lightly lifts up his head. The difference was that the vicious face that he had displayed earlier had been completely replaced by a calm and impassive face...   In the past 3 years, Xiao Yan had endured countless discrimination and taunts. As a result, Xiao Yan was now more mature than before. Perhaps his greatest gain from the past three years was that he had learned to keep his emotions under control.  Looking at the completely different young man, Ge Ye and Nalan Yanran suddenly felt a chill...  This kid, if he stays useless then it isn't a big deal. But if he gains strength, then he will definitely become a dangerous force to be reckoned with... Ge Ye solemnly thought.  "Xiao Yan! Even though I don't know why my actions have infuriated you thus far, but, you... you should still release the marriage!" Slowly letting out a breath, Nalan Yanran pushed her fear and stiffened her face.  "Remember, my visit to Xiao clan was permitted by my teacher, the faction leader of Faction of Misty Clouds!" Pursing her lips, Nalan Yanran said, with a slight hint of helplessness: "You can understand that my visit today is partly coercion. But you should understand that the reality is harsh and nothing is fair. Even though it shouldn't mean much, you should understand the difference between us, we...we don't have any hope of being together..."  Hearing the absolute statements of the girl, Xiao Yan's mouth curved into a sneer: "Lady Nalan... You should understand, in Dou Qi mainland, a woman going back on her marriage would be embarrass the opposite party in front of everyone. Hehe, I don't really care about being embarrassed, but my father! He's the clan leader, if we accept your request today then how do you expect him to rule over Xiao clan? How will Xiao clan keep a foothold in Wu Tan City?"  Looking at the the furious young man, Nalan Yanran's brows furrowed. She peeked at Xiao Zhan at the end of the hall; he appeared as if he had just aged by a lot. Seeing that, she felt slightly sorry for her actions and bit her lips. After musing for a moment, her eyes lit up. She whispers: "Today's request, it's a little reckless on my part. So, today, I will temporarily take back my request to release my marriage. But, you must promise me something!"  "What promise?"  "I can delay today's request for three years. Three years from now, you will come to Faction of Misty Clouds and challenge me. If I win then I will release the marriage in front of everyone and at that time, you would have performed your clan's rites of adulthood so even if you lose, you won't be affecting your father Xiao Zhan or Xiao clan. Do you accept?"  Hehe, when I lose then, it won't affect the name of my father. But maybe for my entire life, I'll bear the shame of losing. This woman... is too cruel! Xiao Yan felt helpless, he was angry but he couldn't find a source to vent it.  "Lady Nalan, it's not like you don't know the condition of Yan Er. How do you expect him to challenge you? Insulting him like this, is it fun for you?" Xiao Zhan smacked the table and angrily stood up.  "Xiao Zhan shu-shu, when releasing a marriage, there must someone who bears the responsibilities of it. If not for you, I would be releasing the marriage today! Afterwards, I will announce it  to the public!" After being blocked several time, Nalan Yanran was also getting angry and coldly shouted at Xiao Yan: "Since you don't want to hurt the name of Xiao Zhan shu-shu, then accept the challenge! Three years or now, will you choose the former or the later?"  "Nalan Yanran, you don't need to act all high and mighty. The reason behind you releasing this marriage is because you don't think that I, Xiao Yan, a near cripple, match you, a genius. Forgive me for putting things plainly. Besides your beauty, I don't care about anything else of yours! The Faction of Misty Clouds is very strong, I'll admit that. But I am young! I have lots of time. When I was twelve, I was a Dou Zhe, but you, Nalan Yanran, when you were twelve, how many Duan Qi did you have? You're right, I might be crippled right now, but since I created miracles three years ago, why do you think that I can't repeat such miracles in the future? Why do you think that I can't become the genius that I once was?" Facing the aggressive stance, Xiao Yan finally erupted like a volcano. His face became completely serious and his words shocked everyone in the main hall.  Who would have thought that the quiet young man possessed such a sharp tongue!  Nalan's mouth twitched. Even though she was extremely pissed at Xiao Yan, she couldn't find words to argue against his statements. Xiao Yan's words were truth; even though he was crippled now, he was a Dou Zhe back when he was twelve years old. But Nalan Yanran was only Eight Duan Qi at that time...  "Lady Nalan, because of Grandfather Nalan, I'll give you some advice. Thirty years east, thirty years west, don't you dare bully me because I'm poor now." Xiao Yan's tough words made Nalan stiffen.  "Yes! What a great saying, don't you dare bully me because I'm poor now! My son can't possibly be ordinary!" At the end of the hall, Xiao Zhan's eyes were lit with vigor and his heavy palms slammed against the table, causing tea to splatter everywhere.  Clenching her teeth and staring at the sneering young man in front of her, Nalan became so angry that her head began to feel dizzy. Nalan Yanran had been spoiled since birth and had never been humiliated by someone the same age as her. Her childish voice climbed another pitch: "What is your basis for humiliating me? Even if your talent before was unsurpassed by anyone, the you now... you're a cripple now! Okay, I, Nalan Yanran, will wait for the day that you surpass me. Today's release, I won't mention it any more, but three years from now, I will wait for you at Faction of Misty Clouds. If you have the guts, then show me how you've changed your situation! If you defeat me then... then I, Nalan Yanran, will be your slave for the rest of my life!"  "Of course, if you're still crippled three years later then you better prepare the contract to release our marriage!"  Looking at the ashen face of the girl, Xiao Yan ridicules: "It won't take three years! I wouldn't want you even if you were begging me to become my wife!" After saying that, Xiao Yan ignored the frozen face of Yanran and turned around. Quickly walking forward to a table, he took out a paper and started to write!  The ink slowly dropped onto the paper, and finally, his pen stopped moving.  Suddenly, Xiao Yan's right hand reached for a short sword on the desk and pointed the sharp blade at his left hand. As soon as readied the sword, he firmly drew blood from his left hand.  His bloodied hand pressed down on the white paper, leaving a glaring red mark.  Lightly picking up the contract, Xiao Yan laughed, a laugh of victory. When he walked past Yanran, he smashed the contract on the table.  "Don't you dare think that I, Xiao Yan, think highly of some genius wife. This contract, isn't a contract to release the marriage but rather, I am divorcing you from the Xiao Clan! From now on, you, Nalan Yanran, have no relations with the Xiao Clan!"  "You... You dare divorce me?" Looking at the bloody contract on the table, Nalan Yanran's eyes opened wide in disbelief. With her beauty, talent and background, to have been divorced by a small clan's cripple? This sudden turn of events  made her think that she was in a dream!  Coldly looking at Nalan Yanran's dumbfounded expression, Xiao Yan turned around and kneels in front of Xiao Zhan. He gave a heavy Kowtow, biting his lips,and didn't say anything...  Even though Xiao Yan actually divorced Nalan Yanran, when the events spread out, others might not think that it's the truth. They, who don't know what happened, would think that Nalan Yanran used her tyrannical background for force Xiao clan to release the marriage. After all, with Yanran's beauty, talent and background, a cripple from Xiao clan would never be able to match her. No one would think that Xiao Yan had the boldness to divorce a future faction leader of the Faction of Misty Clouds. Because of that, being Xiao Yan's father, Xiao Zhan would probably have to endure endless ridicule.  Looking at the kneeling Xiao Yan and understanding the guilty feelings that his son was having, Xiao Zhan helplessly smiled: "I believe that my son won't stay crippled forever. Gossip won't stand a chance when the hard facts come out in the future!"  "Father, three years from now, I will go to Faction of Misty Clouds and redeem today's shame!" With slightly wet eyes, Xiao Yan did another heavy kowtow and stood up. Without hesitating, Xiao Yan walked towards the door of the main hall.  When he passed Nalan Yanran, Xiao Yan pauses of a moment and spits out cold words from his young mouth.  "Three years from now, I will find you!"  The shadow of the young man, under the shining sun, extended extremely far. Looking at it, it seemed very lonely.  Nalan Yanran's small mouth opened but no sound came out. She stared at the disappearing back of Xiao Ya and the contract in her hand felt as heavy as a mountain...  "Ahem, since your goal has been accomplished, please leave now." Looking at the receding young man, even though Xiao Zhan's face was impassive, the hands inside of his sleeve curled into fists so tight that the fingers became a pale white.  "Xiao shu-shu, I apologize for today's event. If you have time in the future, make sure to come visit the Nalan Clan!" Lightly bowing to the impassive Xiao Zhan, Nalan also didn't want to stay. She quickly stood up and went towards the door of the main hall. Behind her, Ge Ye and the handsome young man quickly followed her.  "Take the Qi Gathering Powder!" Waving his hand, Xiao Zhan threw the jade box on the table at them.  Ge Ye quickly caught the falling box and bitterly smiled while placing the box within his ring.  "Lady Nalan, hopefully you won't regret your actions today. And also, don't assume that with Faction of Misty Clouds behind you, you can do anything you want. There are a lot of people stronger than Yun Yun..." When Nalan Yanran was about to exit the door, a clear girl's cold voice sounded within the hall.  The steps of the three paused and they glanced towards the corner where the voice came from, finding a purple dressed girl slowly flipping a book.  The sunlight shined through the window next to her and perfectly wrapped around the girl. From afar, she looked like a heavenly purple lotus blooming, clean and graceful, as if she was from the heavens.  As if she felt the glances from the three, the girl picked her head up from the old book and within the autumn like eyes of hers, a thin line of golden flame peeked out.  Looking at the thin flame within the girl's eyes, Ge Ye immediately stiffened and a fearful expression crossed his wizened face. His shriveled hands immediate grabbed the confused Nalan Yanran and young man and he fled from the main hall as if he was fearing for his life.  Looking at the actions of Ge Ye, except for a few people, the others all had expressions of confusion. Emotionlessly leaving the main hall, the frustrated Xiao Yan followed his daily routine and slowly climbed to the top of the mountain behind the clan building. Sitting at the top of the mountain, Xiao Yan calmly watched the steep mountaintops far away being shrouded in mist. There, in the mist, was the Jia Ma Empire's famous Magic Beast Mountain Range. "Hehe, power ah... In this world, without power, you're not even worth some excrement. At least, no one tries to trample on excrement." With shoulders waving up and down, the young man's soft, self-taunting voice echoed across the top of the mountain, filling the air with sadness. Yanking his hair, Xiao Yan bit down on his lip, allowing the bloody taste to spread in his mouth. Even though he didn't let his emotions get to him in the main hall, the Nalan Yanran's words stabbed at his heart like knives. "I will never be insulted like this again!" Opening his left hand, which still had the bloody scar from the events of the day, Xiao Yan's voice was hoarse but firm. "Hehe, kid, looks like you need some help." Right when Xiao Yan pledged his oath, a wizened, strange laugh entered his ear. Xiao Yan's face changed and he immediately turned around. With a hawk-like gaze, he scanned his surroundings but didn't even find a shadow... "Hehe, stop searching, I'm on your finger." Right when Xiao Yan thought that he was hallucinating, the strange laugh aimlessly sounded again. Xiao Yan's eyes contracted and his gaze fell on his right hand's black ring. "You're talking?" Enduring his heart's pounding, Xiao Yan tried to keep his voice calm. "Kid, you're quite calm, to not have been scared witless." From the ring, a taunting voice sounded. "Who are you? Why are you in my ring? What are trying to do?" After calming himself, Xiao Yan asked the essential questions. "Who am I? You don't need to know, I won't harm you. Hahaha, after all these years, I finally found someone with a soul strong enough. What luck! Hehe, I should thank you for your offerings over the past three years, otherwise I would probably still be sleeping." "Offerings?" Xiao Yan blinked his eyes in confusion. After a moment, his face darkened and chilling words jumped out of his teeth with difficulty: "My Dou Qi disappearing... you did that?" "Hehe, I had to do that, kid don't be mad at me." "You F*CKER!" The normally calm and composed Xiao Yan became enraged like a lunatic. His small face was filled with savagery, and without caring that the ring was the only memento of his mother, he ripped the ring off of his finger and flung it over the cliff with all of his might. As the ring left his hand, Xiao Yan's mind finally cleared. Hurriedly he tried to catch the flying ring but the ring had already passed cliff, freefalling down the mountain... Staring at the ring disappearing into the mist, Xiao Yan was stunned for a long time. Finally, his face lost its savagery and calmed. He smacked his forehead, upset: "Idiot that was too reckless, too reckless!" To realize that the culprit of his humiliation for the past three years was the ring he always wore, it was unsurprising that Xiao Yan reacted so violently. After sitting at the edge of the cliff for a long time, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. Standing up, he prepared to go back but his eyes widened and his finger shakily pointed at the thing in front of him. In front of Xiao Yan was the pitch-black ring, floating in the sky. But the thing that surprised Xiao Yan the most was the transparent wizened figure above the ring... "Hehe, kid, you don't need to be so mad do you? I only took three years of your Dou Qi." The transparent elder smiled at the stunned Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan's mouth twitched and he pushing down his anger. He said: "Geezer, since you were hiding within the ring, then you should know how much pain you've caused me since you took my Dou Qi right?" "But with these three years of humiliations, you've matured right? Do you think that three years ago you would have had this kind of tolerance and mindset?" Xiao Yan furrowed his brows but his emotions started to calm down. After the rage, a hint of happiness took over Xiao Yan. Since he knew why his Dou Qi was disappearing, his talent had returned! Thinking about the chance to take off the title of crippled that countless others had put on him, Xiao Yan felt as if he had been reborn. The detestable elder in front him didn't look as annoying as before. Some things, after they disappear, would make one start appreciating their value! After losing and regaining it, one treasures it more! Lightly twisting his wrist, Xiao Yan let out a long breath and said: "Even though I don't know who you are, I would like to know if you plan on staying in the ring to steal my Dou Qi. If that's the case then I would ask for you to find a new owner, I can't afford to keep on raising you." "Hehe, other people don't have as strong of Soul Perception as you." The elder stroked his beard: "Since I already chose to appear, then before you give me permission I won't take your Dou Qi." Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and sneered without saying anything. He had already decided, regardless of anything the elder says, he would not keep that ring by his side. "Kid, do you want to become strong? Do you want to be respected by other?" Even though Xiao Yan had already decided to not have anything more to do with the elder, his heart started beating rapidly when he heard those words. "I already know why my Dou Qi was disappearing and with my talent, why do I need you to become strong?" Letting out a small breath, Xiao Yan smoothly said. He knew that there were no free lunches in this world. To owe a mysterious person a favor, isn't a smart move. "Kid, even though your talent is pretty good, you should know that you're already 15 but your Dou Qi is only at 3 Duan. I think that I heard that your adult ceremony is next year right? Do you think that within a year, using your talent and hard work you can get to 7 Duan Qi? In addition, the girl who you promised to fight three years from now doesn't have shabby talent either. You want to catch up and surpass her? It's not going to be easy." The elder's face that was full of wrinkles blossomed like a Chrysanthemum. "If you didn't take my Dou Qi, then do you think that any of this would have happened? You old f*cker!" After his biggest weakness was exposed, Xiao Yan's face darkened once again and he started to curse. After cursing, Xiao Yan felt a hint of despair. In his current situation, no matter how much he cursed, there would be no effect. The practice of Dou Qi required a strong foundation. Back when he was four, it took him 6 years to get to 9 Duan Dou Qi. Even with his talent, getting to 7 Duan Qi in just one year was hopeless. Sighing depressingly, Xiao Yan glanced at the pretentious elder. The edge of his mouth curled and he asked: "Do you have a solution?" "Maybe." The elder vaguely replied. "If you help me to get to 7 Duan Qi in just one year then I'll forgive you for taking my Dou Qi for three years. How's that?" Xiao Yan probingly asked. "Hehe, wishful thinking kid." "If you can't help me then why should I keep you, someone useless, by my side? You should find another unfortunate person..." Xiao Yan knew that the transparent elder couldn't randomly take Dou Qi from other people so he knew that he had some leverage in the negotiations. "You're not even remotely close to a 15 year old young man. Looks like these three years really helped you grow a lot. Did my plan backfire?" Looking at the clever Xiao Yan, the elder paused and then dumbfoundedly shook his head. Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and lightly said: "If you want me to keep you by my side then you should at least have some sincerity right?" "What a sharp mouthed kid. Alright, alright, after all, I do need your help." Without another choice, the elder nodded and slowly came to the ground. After examining Xiao Yan for a while, a treacherous smile spread across his face. But as soon as it appeared, it left and the elder pondered for a moment before unwilling asking: "Do you want to become an alchemist?" "Alchemist?" Hearing the elder's words, Xiao Yan paused before continuing: "In the Dou Qi mainland, everyone wants to become an Alchemist, but is it that easy to become an alchemist? There are so many harsh requirements..." Suddenly, Xiao Yan's voice fell and he raised his head: "I MET THE REQUIREMENTS?" Enjoying the shocked yet excited expression that Xiao Yan showed, the elder stroked his beard slowly. After looking over Xiao Yan for a few more seconds, he finally said with some helplessness: "Even though you barely make the cut, I owe you a favor. Hah, whatever, I'll let this count as the favor returned..." Looking at the reluctant elder, Xiao Yan thought that the geezer was lying about him barely making the cut, but he was too lazy to probe further. Despite his excitement, he still had his suspicions. "Even if I make the cut, alchemists are taught by other alchemists. Are you an alchemist?" Looking at the suspicious little face of Xiao Yan, the elder straightened and with pride he said, "Yup, I'm an alchemist!" Blinking his eyes, Xiao Yan's gaze at the elder became bright. Alchemists, those are really rare... "Mister, if you don't mind me asking, what rank alchemist were you before?" Xiao Yan licked his lips and his young voice was infused with a hint of respect. In Dou Qi mainland, even though alchemists were very rare, there were still differences between alchemists. From low to high, the stages for alchemists range from the lowest, 1, to the highest, 9. The Pill King Gu He that made the Gathering Qi Powder that Nalan Yanran offered was a sixth stage alchemist and within the Jia Ma Empire, he could be considered to be the top alchemist! "What stage? Hehe, I don't remember ... . Hey, kid, do you want to learn it or not?" the elder impatiently asked while shaking his head. "Of course, I want to!" Xiao Yan didn't hesitate anymore and hurriedly nodded with his small head. Alchemists, even with forces as powerful as Faction of Misty Clouds, were treated with respect and deference. "Hehe, you want to? Since you want to, then you should pay your respects to your teachers." The elder sat on a green rock and coiled his legs beneath himself. "I need to pay my respects to my teacher?" "Ridiculous! To not pay your respects and still expect me to teach you all that I know? You're dreaming!" The elder rolled his eyes, looks like the pedantic elder really cared about these student-teacher relationships. Helpless with a dour face, Xiao Yan could only respectfully pay his respects to the elder to become an honorable alchemist. After watching Xiao Yan finish paying his respects, the elder finally nodded his head, satisfied. In his voice, a hint of intimacy appeared: "My name is Yao Lao. As for my origin, you don't need to know for now so that you don't get distracted. All you need to know is that the Pill King is ... only trash in my eyes." The edges of his mouth twitching, Xiao Yan watched the elder's carefree expression and thought: What is this geezer? The famous Pill King Gu He in Jia Ma Empire is only trash? If this spreads then the whole of Jia Ma would probably assume that he's mentally ill. Lightly taking in a breath and pushing down his shock, Xiao Yan's eyes darted around and with some droll he asked: "Umm teacher, how will you help me to get to 7 Duan Qi within one year?" "Even though for the past three years your Dou Qi has always been declining, your foundation in Dou Qi is much firmer than other people. In Dou Qi training, the foundation is the most important! Later, you'll be able to discover how many benefits these three years have brought you!" Yao Lao's smile slowly disappeared and he took on a more serious expression. Xiao Yan was stunned, he was never told that having one's strength taken away would bring benefits. "Then when are you going to teach me alchemy?" Xiao Yan steered his thoughts onto the most important thing. "To become an alchemist, you need to have Dou Qi of the Fire-Attribute. So, before you become an alchemist you have to at least become a Dou Zhe and learn a fire attribute Dou Qi method!" Xiao Yan held out his hand and laughingly asked: "Fire attribute Dou Qi method? Hehe, teacher, since I'm your student, you should give me a Tian Level fire attribute Dou Qi method, right?" Hearing that, Yan Lao indignantly scolded Xiao Yan: "Really? Do you think that Tian Stage Dou Qi Methods are like potatoes in the ground? How could you say something like that?!" "Geezer, since I've already become your student, you can't possibly let me go into my clan to find Dou Qi methods, right? Our clan's top fire attribute Dou Qi method is only a high huang level. That's way too shabby for an alchemist!" Xiao Yan's face showed how depressed he was. "Brat, I'm your teacher, not a geezer!" Hearing Xiao Yan's disrespectful words, Yao Lao rolled his eyes when he realized that Xiao Yan didn't care about being respectful to his elders. "Hmph! Since you're my student, I wouldn't let you practice some shabby methods. Tian Stage Methods? I don't have them! But I have a method that's a lot stronger than a normal Tian Stage Method. Do you want to learn it?" Yao Lao's turbid old eyes suddenly became conspiratorial. "Stronger than a Tian Stage Dou Qi Method?" His heart beats rapidly. Xiao Yan swallowed some saliva and in his pitch black eyes, a hint of anticipation could be found. "Then what level Dou Qi Method is it?" "Low Huang Level." Yao Lao's light laughter made Xiao Yan's face stiffen. "Geezer, you were playing me?" A furious voice sounded on the peak of the mountain. Looking at the twisted face of the young man, Yao Lao started laughing. To be able to make the calm Xiao Yan that mad, he had a feeling of accomplishment. "What's strange about that Dou Qi Method?" Watching Yao Lao´s bantering face, Xiao Yan suddenly calmed down. "It can evolve!" Xiao Yan's eyes widened and without blinking, Xiao Yan stared at Yao Lao's face, trying to find a hint that Yao Lao was lying, but after a few seconds, he shook his head: "No way! I've never heard of any Dou Qi method that can evolve!" "Huu, what do you know? Dou Qi mainland is huge and strange people and things happen all the time. In your limited mind, you haven't even gone outside of Jia Ma Empire. There are tons of impossible things that are actually possible." Xiao Yan paused before saying: "Then have you ever heard about Dou Qi Methods that can evolve?" Yao Lao's smile stiffened: "Because there aren't any other like it, this Dou Qi Method is unique!" "It can evolve?" Looking at Yao Lao's serious face, Xiao Yan couldn't help but ask again. "It can evolve!" Yao Lao seriously nodded. "Have you tried it?" "Oh... No." "Have other people tried it?" "Oh... No." On Xiao Yan's forehead, a vein could be seen. With his hands curled tightly, Xiao Yan tried to resist his impulse to go over and punch the elder. "If no one else has ever tried it, then how do you know that it can evolve?" "It's explained like that on the Dou Qi Method." "There really are such Dou Qi Methods?" His brows furrowed, Xiao Yan hesitated before saying: "Can you let me see it?" "Hehe..." Looking at the curious Xiao Yan, Yao Lao's mouth opened, but what came out wasn't what Xiao Yan was expecting. "Never mind. There's no use if you see it now so why don't you become a Dou Zhe first before I pass it on to you." Xiao Yan's outstretched hand paused and after the edge of his mouth twitched for a while, he spat out three words: "You're ruthless!" Happily laughing, Yao Lao ignored the anger-filled pupils of Xiao Yan and said: "Our current mission is to get your Dou Qi up to 7 Duan within 1 year." Xiao Yan pushed down his curiosity and anger for the Dou Qi Method and asked with clenched teeth, "How are you going to do that?" Yao Lao with a serious face said: "When one begins to train their Dou Qi, their main focus is to build muscle and strengthen internal Qi paths so that they have a foundation for when they materialize their Dou Qi within their body. Because people at your age have weak internal Qi paths and can be molded, you need to take the training process step by step and you can't use outside force to boost your training speed or else in the future when your Dou Qi becomes stronger, your internal Qi paths won't be able to withstand the force of Dou Qi pushing through the paths and your Qi paths would burst which would be when you would die." Xiao Yan knew this as well as Yao Lao because in the three years that he was crippled, his father was very worried and quite a few times, he tried to forcibly push Dou Qi into Xiao Yan's body, but every time, at the last second, he would stop so Xiao Yan knew the stakes involved. Yao Lao glanced at the calm Xiao Yan and satisfiedly nodded his head. "But that only applies to others. You're different. Your internal foundation was already solid and reliable three years ago and since then because of your firm personality, you never stopped training your Qi. Therefore, your foundation right now, I can say that it is great!" "So you want to use outside forces to train my Qi? Like pills?" "Pretty much. But with the toughness of your Qi paths right now, you won't be able to take the force of any of the pills going through your Qi paths. Even the rudimentary Gathering Qi Powder, you wouldn't be able to use!" "The rudimentary Gathering Qi Powder..." Xiao Yan wanted to roll his eyes again. In Jia Ma Empire, a Gathering Qi Powder would fetch sky-high prices. But from his teacher, these Gathering Qi Powder became the most rudimentary things. The difference between the two left Xiao Yan stunned. "Then your plan?" Taking a deep breath, Xiao Yan recovered and furrowed his brows again. "Hehe, since pills are too fierce and can hurt your Qi paths, we need to use a milder method!" Yao Lao smiles and says: "Tomorrow, prepare for me three complete stalks of Purple Leaved Bluegrass, where the older they are, the better. Also, I need two stalks of Bone Washing Flower, the age of it doesn't matter. Oh right, I'll also need a level 1 wood attributed monster core. These are all low-grade material so you should be able to get them... Someone's coming, I'll go back into the ring! Also, don't let anyone else know of my existence, including your closest family." After saying that, Yao Lao ignored the stunned Xiao Yan and jumped into the black ring. The ring shakes a bit and flies onto Xiao Yan's finger. "Three stalks of Purple Leaved Bluegrass? Two stalks of Bone Washing Flower? A wood attribute monster core? Geezer, are you sure that's right? Do you think that I'm some royal prince? These things, added altogether costs over a thousand gold coin! After a few years of saving money to the point where I would skip meals and never spend on luxury items, I only have 400 gold coins. That's only enough for one level 1 wood attribute monster core!" Xiao Yan pointed at the motionless ring and cursed. "That's your own problem. Hehe, other people would lust after my nourishing fluids, but all I'm asking is for you to get the money for the material and you're already crying about that..." Yao Lao's taunting laughter sounded within Xiao Yan's heart. "Damn it! The things that alchemists make can only be afforded by rich people." Xiao Yan helplessly laughed. His allowance each month was only 20 gold coins. This was by no means a small amount; it would be enough for a small normal family to feed themselves for an entire year! But the money that he had was barely enough to buy one of the items that Yao Lao required. This is the difference between alchemists and other people! "Hah, looks like I have to borrow it from someone..." Sighing a depressed breath, Xiao Yan slowly regained his composure and his small face recovered to his normal calm face. Turning his head towards the path up the mountain, he could make out a purple figure climbing the mountain like a spirit. Tiptoeing on the rocks, Xiao Xun was like a beautiful purple butterfly with hypnotizing curves as she gracefully scaled the mountain. As she looks upward, her gaze focuses toward the youth standing next to the cliff. Looking at the youth, Xiao Xun felt surprised. Even though it had only been a couple of hours, she noticed that compare to before, Xiao Yan has obtained something... When their eyes meet, she finally realized what Xiao Yan has regained. His own confidence. After three years, Xiao Yan's brilliance has returned at last. Indulging in the transparent lingering on Xiao Yan's lips, two dimples appear Xiao Xun's pretty face: "Looks like Xiao Yan didn't need Xun Er to come and comfort him..." "People grow after experiencing hardships, don't they?" Xiao Yan shrugs his shoulders. "She will definitely regret it." Xun Er curls her lips and says the words as if she were a judge having the final say on a court case. Xiao Yan lightly smiles, pats his clothes and walks towards her. When he gets near her, looking at Xun Er who's about the same height, he glances at the young but nevertheless pretty face. Suddenly Xiao Yan feels dizzy, remembering the girl who would be drooling all the time and following Xiao Yan everywhere. She's so pretty now... Lightly smiling, Xiao Yan's gaze softens and he rudely pinches Xiao Xun's face underneath her shocked look: "Xun Er's grown up! But you turned out fine, not forgetting how Xiao Yan ge-ge would be covered with bruises trying to pick fruit from the trees." Stunned at Xiao Yan's intimate actions, Xun Er stiffens for a whole second before her pitch-black, free of impurities, eyes smiles. When she was still small, Xiao Yan loved to pinches her cheeks but ever since the event three years ago, he set up an invisible wall next to his heart and pushed everyone out. No matter how hard she tried, she would always be disappointed by the cold and impassive attitude of his... He's back... But, it seems like he still considers me to be immature, he's such a log... Xun Er complains in her heart after an instant, Xun Er criticizes herself for being too greedy. "Xun Er, for these past three years, please don't blame Xiao Yan ge-ge for being like that. I was living day by day but thankfully you were always by my side." Xiao Yan awkwardly nods his head and apologizes. Xun Er sweetly smiles. The grievances she had endured for the past three years disappeared with the awkward apology. "Hah, oh right. Xun Er... How much money do you have?" Letting go of Xun Er's face, Xiao Yan does a hollow laugh and asks. In his clan, with the exception of his father, Xun Er was the only person that was in a good relationship with him. He had just shamed his father this morning so he could not bear to face his father to ask for money, which is why he asked Xun Er. gun truy?n: Truy?nYY. "Money?" Blinking her crystal clear eyes, Xun Er is taken by surprise: "Xiao Yan ge-ge needs money?" "Yes... I want to buy some items, though I'm a bit short." Xiao Yan felt embarrassed, this was the first time he borrowed money from a girl. Looking at the usual frigid Xiao Yan now in distress, Xiao Xun Er looks at a completely different person. Covering her mouth and smiling cutely: "I have more than a thousand gold coins, is that enough? If not..." While speaking, Xun Er's fingers behind her swiftly flick and a purple gold card suddenly appears between her fingers. On the card are five different waves of color. 5 Wave Purple Cold Card, in Dou Qi mainland, you have to be at least a Dou Ling(If Dou Zhe is first, Dou Ling is 4th) to have the honor of using this type of gold card that represents their rank, Of course, some special powers also have the privilege of getting the card. "That's enough, that's enough..." Happily nodding his head, Xiao Yan forcefully tried to stop himself from pinching Xun Er's cute face. "Don't worry, I'll pay you back later." Xiao Yan promises while patting his chest. "You don't need to pay me back..." Xun Er pouts and quickly hides her purple gold card. "Let's go! It's almost night now, tomorrow I'll bring you to Wu Tang City for a walk." Xiao Yan waved towards the girl and cheerfully descended the mountain. Standing still, Xun Er delightfully looked at the youth who had regained his boldness from three years ago, Smiling softly, she murmured: "Nalan Yanran, should I despise you or be grateful to you?" Early morning, the sun shone warmly through the window onto the body of the cross-legged youth in meditation. "Whew..." After meditating nearly all night, Xiao Yan inhaled deeply, a translucent white airflow that was visible to the naked eyes went through his mouth and nose and into his body, nursing his body and bones. White light shined from his eyes as he suddenly opened his eyes. Xiao Yan stretched himself and passionately says "This is exactly this feeling, after three years, the feeling of Qi has returned!" He slowly gets out of his bed, exercises himself a bit, before starting changing. From outside the room, Xun Er's voice softly carries inside: "Xiao Yan ge-ge, still sleeping?" She arrived here so early. Shaking his head, Xiao Yan turned around and then searched his drawers. Finally, with reluctance, he pulled out a small box and carefully opened it. He narrowed his eyes from the glint of silver inside that box. "And this is my entire savings..." Holding his money box, Xiao Yan smiled bitterly while shaking his head. Xiao Yan gently smiled as he walked out of his room and saw the dazzling girl in front of his door. Xun Er had changed into a pale green outfit that made her looked even more naturally beautiful. She also had a pair of tight pants that stretched across her slender thighs and long legs, emphasizing her curves. With long legs, Xun Er can be compared to young girls on earth, full of youthful vitality and seductivity, of course, she has her special elegance which Xiao Yan had never seen on any other girl but her... "Here, it's what you'll need." Looking at Xiao Yan exiting his room, Xun Er smiled and handed him a black card. This is a common card, the maximum it can contain is only 5000 gold coins. Receiving the black card, Xiao Yan teases: "Little girl, why are you wearing such an attractive outfit? Could it be you're having a date with somebody else?" "Yeah, this is the first time in three years that Xiao Yan ge-ge has invited me out, Xun Er is very flattered so of course I have to dress up a little." Xiao Yan's intimate tease made Xun Er's eyes bend into a shallow crescent shape while smiling coquettishly. Reluctantly shaking his head, Xiao Yan smiles back happily. They chat while walking together towards the city, at about halfway, they were greeted by some clansmen looking at their affectionate conversation with a strange face. Xun Er, be it beauty or talent, is the brightest pearl of the young generation in the clan. She usually is friendly to everybody but under her light smile is indifference, greetings with her are easy, but to start a long conversation would be very difficult. Ignoring the looks of the other clansmen, Xian Yan quickly leads Xun Er out of the clan before slowing down and leisurely peeking at the stall on the side of the street... Wu Tang City lives up to its name of being one of the larger cities in Jia Ma Empire by the sheer number of people living in it. Even though the sun was beating down, on the streets were thousands if not tens of thousands of people, there would even be one or two bizarre races. Maybe it was because of Xiao Yan beside her, but Xun Er became a lot more active after she exited the clan. She tugged the reluctant Xiao Yan into a variety of stall. Her tender laughter made the scorching street a little cooler. When Xun Er finally got tired, Xiao Yan finally brang her to the nearby Pharmacy. After spending about 900 gold coins, he bought 3 stalks of 20 year Purple Leaved Bluegrass along with two stalks of 5 year Bone Washing Grass. These were both low end materials and would be able to bought at a regular pharmacy. For higher end materials, Xiao Yan would have had to find them himself or buy them at an auction or if he was lucky, in a high end pharmacy. Looking at the rapidly decreasing funds, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled. He realized how important money was in Dou Qi Mainland... Anyways, he got all of the herbs, all that was left was the level one wood attributed monster core!
Monster cores, in the Dou Qi Mainland, they are also known as Magic Crystals. The Monster Core is the energy nuclei within a magic monster. The monster core is filled with extremely violent world energy. When facing this kind of violent world energy, even a Dou Wang wouldn’t risk absorbing a monster core.
Even though Monster cores cannot be absorbed directly, it is a core ingredient in alchemy. A monster core that goes through an Alchemist’s’ refining can be infused with some herbs to become desirable and expensive pills that can increases one’s strength.
Furthermore, monster cores can be placed on weapons. The weapon that has been fused with a monster core does not only have increased destructive power, it can also have special Dou Qi effects, and becomes a highly sought after commodity in the Dou Qi Mainland.
Besides weapons, Monster Cores can also be added to armors and defensive equipment. The defensive equipment that have Monster Cores have an extreme defense and give their users an extra safety net when they’re in danger.
With that many uses, monster cores are naturally the most sought after items within the Dou Qi Mainland. Not only Dou Zhes but even respectable Alchemists search in person for high level monster cores in order to create higher quality level pills.
Under such demand, the supply for monster cores on the mainland is always unable to meet the demand from the buyers, thus whenever a high level core appears in any auction or other setting, it was bought immediately at a high price.
Because of the high value of monster cores, many mercenary groups specialize in killing magic monsters for a living but getting a monster core is not a simple task.
First, magic monsters are not only extremely strong but also very cunning. Because of their devious nature and special attacking methods, magical beasts can be much stronger than humans of the same rank. Hence, without outstanding power of your own, trying to kill a magical beast on your own is impossible and may possibly lose your life without getting a magical core.
Even if you do kill a magic beast, not all magical beasts possess a magic core, the probability of a magical beast having a core is almost random so a mercenary group could have half of their force killed trying to kill a magic monster and yet not find a core. These kinds of incidents happen all the time in Dou Qi Mainland...
Thus the price of monster cores in Dou Qi Mainland are all very expensive.
......
Bringing Xun Er through twisting alleys, Xiao Yan finally arrives at a market that’s slightly south in the city. In Wu Tang city there are a few medium sized markets and all of them are controlled by one of the three clans. The market Xiao Yan is going in is under Xiao clan’s control.
Even though it’s under Xiao clan’s control, Xiao Clan is actually only maintaining order and safety in the market. And for compensation, be it mercenaries or merchants who set up stalls, they have to pay taxes to the clan, this is the rule of Dou Qi Mainland for a long time and rarely anybody would try to go against it.
At the front entrance of the market, there were two guards from Xiao clan. They undoubtedly knew Xiao Yan and Xun Er, judging from when the guards saw them coming, the guards paused and immediately bowed.
Slightly nodding his head, Xiao Yan walked inside and looking at the neverending stream of people, he couldn’t help himself from licking his lips. No wonder the clan keeps the market under strict control, with this many people visiting the market, the profits for the clan can’t be low...
"Third young master, Miss Xun Er, would you like to buy something in the market?" Right when the two were dizzy looking at the sheer number of people, a respectful voice sounded behind them.
Hearing the sound, Xiao Yan turned his head. Behind him were seven to eight guys that were wearing the Xiao Clan’s uniform. The speaker appeared to be a 30 years old mature man, wearing a badge with 6 gold stars, he is obviously a six star Dou Zhe.
Noticing the doubt in Xiao Yan’s eyes, the man honestly smiled and said: "Third young master, I’m called Pei En. The clan leader appointed me to be the leader of the guards for maintaining safety in the market. Ah! Last year during young master’s birthday, I, Pei En came..."
"Oh, it’s Uncle Pei En!"
Xiao Yan blinked and even though he does not have any impression of Pei En, his introduction made Xiao Yan smile. Since the man was personally appointed by his father, he would naturally be his subordinate, there would be no issues with loyalty.
Even though the Xiao Clan wasn’t some big and influential force, the clan was divided into different factions. If the man standing in front of him was under the control of the elders, he would have never been so kind and would have just said some customary greetings.
"I was bored in the clan so I decided to come out and look around. Uncle Pei En, you should go and do your work, if I have any questions, I’ll be sure to ask you." Xiao Yan’s young voice didn’t have any hints of arrogance that a normal young master might have; instead, his voice was soft and respectful, anyone who heard it would feel a slight sense of pride and joy.
With another Uncle, the smile on Pei En’s face widened and became more sincere. Nodding his head, he said: "Then enjoy looking around third young master. Our people are all over the market so if you need anything then just call out for us."
Respectfully nodding his head, Xiao Yan pulls Xun Er and plunged into the horde of people, disappearing from Pei En’s sight...
"Pa Li, bring two men and follow Third Young Master. Also, warn the thieves in the market that if any of them have any ideas on Third Young Master or Xun Er then they don’t need to be in this market anymore." Looking at the disappearing young boy and girl, Pei En turned around and his honest face was replaced by a cunning and capable face.
"Yes, captain!" One of the men lowly answered and with a wave of his hand, him and two other men also go into the multitudes of people.
"Haha, Third Young Master is still so gentle, it allows people to be relaxed around him..." Looking at the three men mixing in with the crowd, Pei En smiles but in an instant, the smile turns into a frown and he sighed: "Third Young Master is such a nice person, it’s regretful, haa..."
Regretfully shaking his head, Pei En leads his remaining underlings and goes to patrol the streets.
...
Lazily following Xiao Yan, Xun Er "accidentally" glance behind her and smiled: "Xiao Yan ge-ge. Pei En’s quite nice."
Xiao Yan answered with a yup and scans towards a nearby stall. His soul perception was far greater than normal people so he could detect the guards following him. Looking back forward, Xiao Yan slows down and walks side by side with Xun Er. Tilting his head, he jokes: "9 Duan Qi and already able to detect three hiding guards. Xun Er, pretty good..."
Xun Er copies Xiao Yan and cutely shrugged her shoulders, bringing out her trump card: Smile, Stay silent!
Looking at the silent Xun Er, a smile began to form on his lips. Lightly patting her head, he whispers: "Even though I don’t know who you are or where you’re from, I do know that you are my sister and no matter what happens in the future, I will always protect you." Lightly smiling, Xiao Yan speeds up and breaks out of his line from Xun Er.
Her feet stopping, Xun Er stared with her beautiful eyes at the back of the young man that just talked with her. After pausing for a while, a smile begins to creep onto her delicate face.
Within the crowd, her figure was swaying back and forth, like a lotus, elegant and pretty...
"Sister? Xun Er is a very greedy girl though..." Tilting her head, Xun Er mutters and then quickly catches up to the young man in front of her.
......
Following Xiao Yan while he examines the stalls by the side, Xun Er and Xiao Yan slowly move into the more populated and expensive inner parts of the market. The people that come here to buy and sell usually have decent money or physical power.
While Xiao Yan was engrossed in trying to find a Monster Core, Xiao Xun who was bored, walked up to a clean stall and with her pale-white hand picks up a light green bracelet. The bracelet wasn’t crafted with anything special but it had a hint of Ice Silver which made it feel cold to the touch, perfect for hot summer days. In addition, even though the material was quite plain, the craftsmanship wasn’t bad...
Right when Xun Er decided to buy the bracelet, she remembered that she had loaned all of her money to Xiao Yan. Slightly turning around and seeing the busy young man, she could only helplessly shake her head and smile at the old stall owner. Putting down the bracelet, she lazily started moving forward... Her calm manner wouldn’t let her ask anyone to buy anything for her, even if it was Xiao Yan....
After walking forward for a bit, right when the bored Xun Er decided to go back to Xiao Yan, a clear laughter rings from ahead.
"Huh, isn’t this Ms. Xun Er? Hehe, I wouldn’t have thought to find you here, it must be fate."
Her thin brow lightly furrowing, Xun Er tried to find the source of the voice but only saw a group of people. The group was following behind a luxuriously dressed young man.
The young man was only 20+ years old and was quite handsome. His face was slightly pale but his eyes were filled with heat and were staring at the young girl standing in front of him. Within his gaze was also an unrestrained hint of lust.
Looking at the delighted handsome youth, Xun Er’s slim eyebrows wrinkled. Not paying attention to his call, she turned away.
"Miss Xun Er!"
Looking at Xun Er from the side, the handsome but pale young man became immediately anxious and quickly crossed to block her from the front.
Blocked by the youth, Xun Er stopped her steps. Her pair of long and beautiful eyes were lazily narrowed staring at him. Yet she did not utter a single word.
"Miss Xun Er..." Stared at by pupils that were like water drops and despite the fact that he was used to flirting with beauties, his breathing became somewhat hurried. His clever tongue had lost all of its use for the moment.
"Jia Lie Ao young master, if there isn’t anything urgent, please get out the way. I still have to do something."
Looking at this somewhat flush youth, Xun Er finally spoke. Her soft and young voice made the young man’s pale face flush with a sick red.
"Hehe, Miss Xun Er, have you come to the market to buy something? I’m quite free right now so why don’t we look around the market together?" Taking a deep breath within his mind, Jia Lie Ao’s smile was open and gentle. This smile along with his status and handsomeness had successfully landed him quite a few girls.
"Jia Lie Ao young master, I already said that I have something to do! Can you move aside?" Xun Er’s small mouth curves upward and her voice was smooth without any hint of irritation.
Being rejected by Xun Er, the edges of Jia Lie Ao’s mouth twitched but he kept his smile and pulled out a bracelet from his pockets. The bracelet was a light blue gold color and was made from Blue Gold. From the bracelet hanged a smoothed green ball-like monster core. A soft green was emitted from the monster core and scattered its light on the bracelet, giving it a special hue. Looks like this intricate bracelet costs a lot!
"Hehe, since Miss Xun Er has something to do then I, Jia Lie Ao won’t block you anymore." Jiao Lei Ao tightly clutched the bracelet and smiles: "This was a bracelet that I just bought in the market, even though it’s not too expensive, it has a level one wood attribute monster core which greatly helps in the recovery of Dou Qi. Since Miss Xun Er hasn’t become a Dou Zhe yet, this bracelet is perfect for you. This is just a small gift of mine so please don’t say no. After all, I would lose face in front of my underlings..." At the end, Jia Lie Ao purposefully lowered his voice and the underlings around him, as if it was a play, grinned on cue.
Looking at Jia Lie Ao’s actions, Xun Er’s brow lifted. She didn’t know how to deal with such a person.
Right when she was about to refuse, her sight fell onto the green monster core on the bracelet and remembered how Xiao Yan was busily trying to find a wood attribute monster core. Her long eyelashes lightly blinked and her impassive face relaxed a bit...
Looking at Xun Er’s relaxed face, Jia Lie Ao’s heart flutters happily and quickly pushes the Wood Attribute Bracelet forward: "Miss Xun Er, there’s no need to be courteous. Jia Lie Clan and Xiao Clan are both in the top three clans of Wu Tang City so exchanging little gifts is common."
"I’ll take the bracelet and remove the monster core and give to Xiao Yan ge-ge. As for the bracelet, when he’s not paying attention... I’ll throw it away." With this mischievous thought, Xun Er didn’t hesitate anymore and stretches her hand out, about to take the bracelet. Suddenly a hand grabs her hand and stops her from taking the bracelet.
Right when her hand was grabbed, Xun Er pauses in shock before having the Dou Qi in her body flowing in order to protect herself. But right when her hand was about to go free from the grasp, a young male hmph made her obediently stop struggling.
Looking behind her, Xun Er saw Xiao Yan. When her sight moved a bit higher, she saw a harsh young face.
"Don’t you know what he’s like?" Scowling at Xun Er, Xiao Yan criticized himself in his mind. Then he looks up and says: "Jia Lie Ao young master, your thought is graciously accepted by Xun Er but as for the gift, you should take it back."
Looking at the destroyed atmosphere, a hint of anger flashed within Jia Lie Ao’s eyes. But, in front of Xun Er, he tried to keep his "gentlemanly" air and waxily smiles: "Xiao Yan young master, I saw that Miss Xun Er didn’t have any jewelry so I wanted to help her a bit. Do you not want to let her have a few small trinkets to accentuate her beauty?"
Helplessly sighing, Xiao Yan glances at the Wood Attribute bracelet in Jia Lie Ao’s hand and took out another green bracelet and with some frustration, asks: "Do you really like bracelets? Here you go, don’t take other people’s stuff for no reason. I already told you that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The ones who offer free stuff always have a hidden motive. With your innocent look, you may have been sold by someone and still wouldn’t know what had happened."
Hearing Xiao Yan’s words that were obviously directed at him, Jia Lie Ao’s face becomes cold. But when he saw the bracelet on Xiao Yan’s hand, he couldn’t help but laugh.
The bracelet in Xiao Yan’s hands, from a material standpoint, couldn’t have costed more that 5 Gold Coins. While, his Wood Attribute Bracelet, which had an authentic monster core, cost an entire 1000+ gold coins. The two bracelets, no matter how you look at it, either price or actual usefulness, had a huge difference and Xiao Yan’s bracelet couldn’t even compare to the Wood Attribute Bracelet. So, when Jia Lie Ao saw Xiao Yan giving such a poor bracelet to the beautiful Xun Er, he couldn’t help but criticize Xiao Yan: "Xiao Yan, I know that you don’t have a high position in your clan, but... but why would you give such pitiful thing to Xun Er?"
Ignoring Jia Lie Ao’s taunt, Xiao Yan looked at the young girl who was staring at the bracelet in his hand and hurriedly asked: "Do you want it or not? If you don’t then I’ll just throw it away, it was only 2-3 gold coins."
"Haa...." Hearing Xiao Yan’s words, not only did Jia Lie Ao start laughing, his underlings also started to laugh at Xiao Yan with a ridiculing tone.
But the ridiculing laugh didn’t continue for long before being cut off as if they had just had their necks cut off. On everyone was a hilariously stunned face.
Xun Er who had been stunned, responded quickly to Xiao Yan’s words. Her two hands almost instinctively reached out and snatched the bracelet in Xiao Yan’s hand. After getting the bracelet, Xun Er realized what she had done, perhaps she had acted a bit too impatient...
A light red blush appeared on her delicate face but Xun Er wasn’t like other people and after a slight period of embarrassment, she graciously hooked the bracelet onto her white wrist. Raising her head and giving a coy smile, she said: "Thank you Xiao Yan ge-ge."
With an ugly face, Jia Lie Ao stared at Xun Er who was quite intimate with Xiao Yan. On his face was apparent jealousy and he said: "Hehe, I didn’t realize that Miss Xun Er’s preferences were so unique. I guess I’ve been mistaken."
Xiao Yan glances at Jia Lie Ao in front of him and his gaze landed on the gold star at his chest. He strangely thought: When I saw him last year, he was only 9 Duan Qi right? Who would have thought that he would be successful in compressing his Dou Qi Cyclone. But, to become a Dou Zhe at the age of 21, his talent is barely decent...
Seeing that Jia Lie Ao had no intention of leaving, Xiao Yan pursed his lips. His wasn’t affected by the power and status behind Jia Lie Ao and since the Xiao Clan and Jia Lie Clan didn’t have good relations in the first place, there was no need for him to act humble. Stroking his nose, Xiao Yan lightly said: "Jia Lia Ao young master, your womanizer habits are known by the entire Wu Tang City. Xun Er is still young and doesn’t have time to play with your flirting games so hopefully you can go after other girls in the future."
"Stay away from him!"
After speaking to Jia Lie Ao, Xiao Yan ignored the green-faced Jia Lie Ao and used his age as an advantage to arrogantly speak to Xun Er.
"Okay."
Xun Er’s agile eyes blinked and nodded without any hesitation. To her, Jia Lie Ao was just a stranger that she saw a couple of times while Xiao Yan, for her, was irreplaceable. Since Xiao Yan told her to stay away from Jia Lie Ao, she’ll just stay away from him.
The choice wasn’t a hard one for Xun Er.
Seeing Xun Er nod at Xiao Yan’s words, Jia Lie Ao’s mouth started twitching. He curled his fists and stared coldly at the calm and impassive young man before him.
Jia Lie Ao’s underlings, seeing that their young master was quite angry, quickly walked forward and surrounded both, Xiao Yan and Xiao Xun. Their gazes revealing their bad intentions.
Even though it was deep within the market, there were still quite a few people around and they turned their questioning gazes towards the surrounded group. Xiao Yan and Jia Lie Ao had quite a reputation in Wu Tang City, Xiao Yan for his fall from genius to cripple and Jia Lie Ao for his less than honorable encounters with other women. Even though they were infamous, they were still well known within the city.
Looking Jia Lie Ao’s group’s movements, Xiao Yan’s brow jumped and on his young face, a hint of confidence creeped. Lightly turning his head, he whistled towards a spot within the market.
Seeing Xiao Yan’s actions, everyone turned their head to the direction in which Xiao Yan whistled and saw the market’s guards furiously coming over under the lead of Pei En.
With his fellow guards, Pei En rushed towards Xiao Yan and quickly, the market’s guards surrounded Jia Lie Ao’s underlings who were surrounding Xiao Yan and Xiao Xun.
"Third young master, anything wrong?" Walking up to Xiao Yan, Pei En swept his glance over Jia Lie Ao and then respectfully asked Xiao Yan.
Xiao Yan lightly smiles and turned to face the green-faced Jia Lie Ao. He nonchalantly said: "Jia Lie Ao young master, this market is controlled by Xiao Clan, are you sure you want to fight here?"
Jia Lie Ao’s eyes revealed his fear for Pei En but he immediately sneered at Xiao Yan: "Do you only know to rely on your clan? If you are a man..."
"What you want to say is, if I am a man then I would fight you one on one. Right?" Xiao Yan waved his hand and cut Jia Lie Ao off.
Jia Lie Ao sneered again and with a hint of challenge, he said: "Yup, are you afraid?"
Looking at the arrogant face of Jia Lie Ao, Xiao Yan helplessly sighed and puts his hand up to feel his forehead. Moments later, he raised his head and shrugs his shoulder and with innocence and naivety, he asked: "Jia Lie Ao young master, I would like to ask, how old are you?"
The edge of Jia Lie Ao’s mouth twitched and he doesn’t respond.
"Big guy, you’re already twenty one. How old am I? Fifteen! You’re actually asking a kid that hasn’t performed his coming of age ritual to fight you? Don’t you feel that your request is over the top, don’t you feel embarrassed?" Xiao Yan’s innocent appearance was so realistic that Xun Er beside him couldn’t help but let out a soft laugh.
"Haha..."
Hearing the young man’s words, the mercenary and merchant stall owners also let out laughs. Xiao Yan was right, at his current age, Xiao Yan could only be considered a kid but Jia Lie Ao would be considered an adult. A challenge of this kind made everyone look down upon Jia Lie Ao.
The laughter of the crowd was like a bucket of cold water and helped Jia Lie Ao regain his calm. From Xiao Yan’s maturity and calmness to his impassive attitude, it was extremely easy for people to forget how old he really was. Therefore, after Xiao Yan said his age, Jia Lie Ao finally remembered that the young man standing in front of him was only fifteen.
Gnashing his teeth, Jia Lie Ao looked at the leering guards behind Xiao Yan and realized that he didn’t have any chance of retaliation today. He could only shake his head and coldly say: "One more year and you’ll be undergoing the coming of age ritual right? Hehe, I think that someone as crippled as you, once you finish the coming of age ritual, will only be sent to some remote and poor village. At that time, you won’t even have the power to enter Wu Tang City, pretty pitiful."
Xiao Yan lightly smiles and nonchalantly shrugs his shoulders.
Jia Lie Ao’s eyelids flickered. He didn’t know why but whenever he saw the calm face of the young man in front of him, a mysterious rage boiled within him. You’re only a cripple and trying to act like you know everything...
Forcefully suppressing his anger, Jia Lie Ao let out a cold hmph and with a wave of his hand, commands his underlings to exit the crowd.
"Oh right...." His steps stopping, Jia Lie Ao seemed to have remembered something and turning back, he said: " Xiao Yan young master, I heard that your Xiao Clan had their marriage with the Nalan Clan revoked. Hehe, actually, that isn’t unexpected. With your Qi talent, you just can’t match the Miss Nalan. Haha..." After saying that, Jia Lie Ao left laughing.
Xiao Yan’s gaze coldly followed the exit of Jia Lie Ao. Tightly holding Xun Er who was about to rush out, he quietly said: "He’s just a mad dog.If he bites you, why should you bite back?"
"But he.. went too far. We can’t just let him off like this?" Her eyebrows furrowing, Xun Er indignantly replied.
"There will always be an opportunity..." Xiao Yan smirked and the coldness coming from his voice made Pei En shuddered. A lion’s bite might not be that scary but a lion that knows patience is another story, a scary one...
"Uncle Pei En, sorry for troubling you." Xiao Yan turned back and smiled gently toward Pei En’s group. The previously intense atmosphere all of a sudden changed into a lighthearted mood.
Impressed by the control over emotions that Xiao Yan exercised, Pei En’s smile was reinforced by a sense of respect. Even with Xiao Yan’s lack of talent, Xiao Yan’s future accomplishments probably wouldn’t be too shabby with his mental prowess.
"Haha, third young master’s joking. This is Xiao Clan’s territory, we wouldn’t allow Jia Lie Clan to do as they please here." Pei Em smiled and seeing that Xiao Yan started to look around, he quickly took his leave along with his men.
Looking at the exiting Pei En and his group, Xiao Yan turned around and ruffled Xun Er’s hair and said slightly forcefully: "A level 1 monster core made you forget your morals? You know as well as I do what kind of person Jia Lie Ao is. The moment you take his stuff, he would definitely ask for favors."
Straightening her hair, Xun Er flipped her hands upwards: "He wanted to give it me, it was free."
Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry: "It isn’t like that’s something precious, did you really need to act like that? Don’t forget, you’re the young genius in Xiao Clan..."
Xun Er wrinkles her nose and raised the bracelet on her wrist. She taunted: "So Xiao Yan ge-ge has also been noticing Xun Er."
Xiao Yan stayed silent and pulling on Xun Er’s hand, they walked towards some stalls deeper in the market...
After walking past quite a few stalls, Xiao Yan’s feet finally stopped. He bent down and stared at a green orb that still had a trace of blood on the stall and said: "I’ve finally found it."
Moving his hand across the stall, Xiao Yan’s was about to grab the monster core when his hand stiffened. A strange foreboding struck his mind...
Licking his lips, Xiao Yan continued to pick up the monster core but his gaze, as if by accident, swept across the stall....
Moments later, his gaze landed on a piece of black metal that was displayed beside the monster core.
The Black Metal Piece seemed extremely old with many specks of rust and even a couple spots of dirt. It looked as if it had just been excavated.
"Hey, Yan Brat, buy the black metal piece, it’s something good..."
Right when Xiao Yan was confused about why he felt such a strong feeling towards the seemingly worthless metal, Yao Lao’s voice sounded in his mind.
Listening to the voice inside his head, Xiao Yan blinked and secretly nodded.
Instead of immediately grabbing the black metal piece, Xiao Yan gently picked up the green monster core that was still dripping blood and looking at the shabby looking mercenary standing behind the stall, he asked cheerfully: "Which magic monster did this monster core comes from?"
"Haha, the eyes of young master are really good! This is a monster core from a first level magic monster named Swallow Wood Fox. It is a high quality core! Our Sharp Teeth Mercenary Group waited 3 days and ambushed 5 Swallow Wood Foxes before finally obtaining this magic core..." Noticing Xiao Yan’s luxurious outfit, the mercenary rapidly advertised his wares.
"If this object is to young master’s liking, I think 500 gold coins would be a good price. Haha, while obtaining this core, we had several brothers who got injured quite heavily..."
Xiao Yan slowly wiped the remaining blood off of the magic core, noticing they haven’t completely clotted yet. He nodded slightly and glanced towards the two golden stars on the chest of the mercenary and commented: "Too expensive! Normally a level one magic core’s price would only be from 400 to 450 gold coins, furthermore, even if the Swallow Wood Fox is a magic beast, its attack power isn’t too high. Are your underlings not Dou Zhes?"
The corner of his mouth slightly jerking, the mercenary laughed dryly. He did not expect the youth standing in front of him to be so knowledgeable about the magic core market and replied: "470 gold coins then, no more no less, we have to live by this..."
"Hahh..." Sighing under the Mercenary’s anxious eyes, Xiao Yan bent down and randomly grabbed many things from the stall, conveniently including the mysterious metal piece in the mess. Then he said: "470 gold coins for all of these..."
Looking at the goods on Xiao Yan’s hands, the mercenary let out a relieved sigh since none of the items in Xiao Yan’s hands were expensive...
"Alright!"
Cheerfully producing some gold coins, Xiao Yan did not waste another moment and left immediately...
"Hah! Brat, to be so cautious in a mundane task of buying things!" The elder’s taunting voice sounded in Xiao Yan’s head as he turned to leave the shop.
"Those bastards are all swindlers, they’ll immediately increase the price if you show interest in their wares. I don’t want to lose money for something stupid like that..." After answering, Xiao Yan stopped paying attention to the Elder inside his ring and leisurely exited the market and returned to the clan with Xun Er.
After parting with Xun Er, Xiao Yan impatiently ran back to his room and carefully locked the door...
Turning his head and seeing the Elder who left the ring since god-knows-when, Xiao Yan brought out the recently purchased herbs and magic core. He hastily asked: "All the required ingredients are here, what do we have to do?"
The Elder cheerfully laughed and his gaze scanned the ingredients on the table before suddenly asking: "Don’t you want to know what that black metal piece is?"
"Eh?" Xiao Yan paused before realizing that the elder was referring to his "accidental" purchase. He quickly took out the Black Metal Piece and examined it from top to bottom. But after examining it, his brows furrowed and asked: "This, what does it do?"
Yao Lao took the Black Metal Piece and laughed: "There seems to be a Dou Technique inside here. And, the creator of this metal piece was probably also an alchemist because only people that have a strong soul perception can feel the power within this metal piece."
"Dou Technique?" Xiao Yan’s eyes brightened and he hurriedly asked: "What level is it?"
In the Dou Qi Mainland, the importance of Dou Techniques isn’t lower than Qi Methods. A strong Dou Technique would allow one to perform at a level far beyond what they are capable of. For example, a Dou Zhe being able to fight a Dou Shi even though his Dou Qi is at a disadvantage.
Dou Techniques and Qi Methods are both split into four levels of decreasing power, Tian, Di, Xuan and Huang. Normally, the Dou Techniques that are easily accessible are at most High Huang level and for higher Dou Techniques, one would have to go to a large clan or faction.
Of course, Dou Qi Mainland is huge and there are some special circumstances in which the top Dou Techniques are lost and found by some lucky individual. The black metal piece that Xiao Yan has right now was probably the lost work of some ancient person...
Yao Lao turned the metal plate around and smiled: "Vacuum Hand : Low Xuan level!"
"Low Xuan level?" Xiao Yan’s face was filled with happiness; he didn’t expect that the "trash" he purchased would have a Xuan level Dou Technique. In his own clan, the Xiao Clan, the highest Dou Technique was only a Middle Xuan level and only the clan leader and some elders could learn it."
"Vacuum Hand: If trained to max, it can suck up boulders that are thousands of pound. Against enemies, it can forcibly suck the blood out of their body."
"Forcibly suck blood from a body?" His face full of surprise, Xiao Yan swallowed dryly and exclaimed: "This... This is awesome! Once the blood leaves the body, they would die right?"
"Don’t be happy yet. This only works if your level is higher than your opponent. If you meet someone stronger than you, they can use the chance to get close to you and the unlucky would be you..." Yao Lao carelessly threw the metal plate to the side, looks like he doesn’t think too highly of the Dou Technique.
Yao Lao was of high status and naturally had high standards but for Xiao Yan, this was a high level Dou Technique! He immediately happily picked it up and laughed: "Even with that, it’s better than the Dou Techniques in the clan. I’ll learn this from now on..."
"Hah, with your 3rd Duan Qi, it would be amazing if you could pull up a tree branch with your Vacuum Hand and you want to suck the blood out of someone...." Shaking his head, Yao Lao heavily criticized Xiao Yan.
Rolling his eyes, Xiao Yan ignored Yao Lao and smiled while hugging the metal piece.
"Look at yourself, having a Low Xuan Dou Technique makes you this happy. You’re embarrassing me ..." Helplessly shaking his head, Yao Lao grabbed the monster core on the table and ordered Xiao Yan: "Go get a huge bowl of water."
Seeing that Yao Lao was about to start refining the pill, Xiao Yan hurriedly put away the Black Metal Piece and cheerfully went to prepare...
......
In the calm room, Yao Lao picked up the Purple Bluegrass with his left hand. Moments later, he lets out a deep breath and a white flame appears in his hand...
When the flame appeared, the temperature within the room rose exponentially.
Without blinking, Xiao Yan stared at the white ball of flame. Although he didn’t know the process of refining pills by Alchemists, to materialize Dou Qi was an impossible task for even his father...
With a calm face, the white fire in Yao Lao’s hands expanded and swallowed the Purple Bluegrass.... Within the flame, the Purple Bluegrass instantly became a green liquid ball...
Yao Lao’s right hand picked up another stalk of Purple Bluegrass and threw it into the white fire...
After throwing all three stalks of Purple Bluegrass into the fire, the ball of green liquid became visibly bigger.
The green liquid slowly shriveled within the fire; the high temperature relentlessly burned the impurities within the green liquid...
With the flame, the green liquid became smaller and smaller in volume. After a few seconds, it was only about the size of a thumb...
Afterwards, Yao Lao threw the two stalks of Bone Washing Flowers into the flame and after they finished burning, the remaining liquid mixed with the original green liquid...
After that was the refinement of the monster core.
The third step took a whole hour but Yao Lao still seemed full of energy and without any signs of fatigue.
After an entire hour, the tough monster core had become a ball of green liquid. The violent energy within the monster core was softened by Yao Lao’s magical formula...
On his hand, the white flame slowly disappeared.
Looking at the green ball floating on top of Yao Lao’s hand, Xiao Yao rubbed his hands together. With his superior Soul Perception, he could clearly feel the bountiful energy within the energy ball...
"Teacher, do I just eat it?" Xiao Yan blinked his eyes and asked impatiently.
"If you want to die then eat it. With your Qi paths, you would become a true cripple within seconds." Giving Xiao Yan a white eye, Yao Lao flicks the ball and it accurately flew into the bowl of water. Immediately, the bowl of clear water turned to a dark green shade.
"From now on, you should train in there. With your talent and barring any unforeseen circumstances, you should be able to get to 7 Duan Qi within a year." Yao Lao claps the dust off of his hands and lightly smiles towards Xiao Yan.
With obvious happiness, Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded his head.
"Oh, I almost forgot. This medicine will only last for two months. Which means, you need to go buy the materials that you got today again every two months." Yao Lao revealed a sly smile.
Xiao Yan happiness disappeared from his face and he nodded his head with reluctance.
"Dammit, only rich people can afford to use this stuff..."
The warm sun filtered through the window and lazily sprayed into the tidy room.
Within the room, a young man with a bare upper body was sitting crossed within a wooden bowl. His two hands were knit together into a strange symbol. His two eyes were shut tightly while his breath was calm but powerful.
In the wooden bowl beneath him, a mysterious green liquid was strangely sparkling.
As he trained longer, the green liquid within the bowl began to slowly evaporate, giving off a light green stream of air. stream slowly lifted upwards and squirmed into the young man’s nose with his breathing.
Once the stream was inside his body, the young man’s face became shiny and smooth like White Jade.
As if he felt the ever increasing Dou Qi within his body, the young man’s face revealed a light smile.
After confirming his success, the young man didn’t stop there. He still had his eyes shut tight and kept his hands in the same position. He didn’t even budge and maintained his maximally efficient position as he greedily sucked up the energy within the green liquid.
The green liquid sticking to the young man’s body was slowly absorbed by his skin, strengthening his bones and cleaning his Qi paths...
Under the young man’s restless absorbance, more and more green streams came up from the bowl and slowly, they became so dense that they covered the young man’s naked body in a layer of mist.
Under the restless training, the bright sunshine that came in through the window slowly became weaker and the room became a lot cooler.
.....
In the wooden bowl, the young man gathered in the final wisps of green air and his eyelashes twitched before opening to reveal two pitch-black eyes.
Within the pitch black eyes, a white glow passed through but this time, it had a hint of green.
Slowly letting out a breath, the young man quickly stood up and let the cool water droplets flow off of his body. Taking a lazy stretch and feeling the abundant Dou Qi within his body, the young man muttered: "At this pace, I can probably get to the fifth Duan Qi in two months..."
After preparing everything, Xiao Yan stayed in his room for an entire half month. In the time he stayed in his room, besides eating and attending bodily functions, he had been training his Qi non-stop.
Even though training was extremely boring and tiring, it was nothing compared to the taunts and ridicules that Xiao Yan had endured for the past three years.
The three full years of taunts had taught him how important strength was in this world....
Even though the days passed tiresomely, the results of them were pleasing.
The effects of Yao Lao’s bowl of elixir was much stronger than what Xiao Yan and even the creator of it, Yao Lao had thought it would have. Yao Lao had predicted that it would take at least a month for Xiao Yan to get to 4 Duan Qi, but Xiao Yan only took half that time....
At this, even Yao Lao was surprised at the speed and efficiency in which Xiao Yan trained. Even though Xiao Yan had done this before, the speed at which he was going right now, isn’t a bit too incredible?
The most important and toughest part about training Dou Qi is in the basics. The 10 Duan Qi would take people 10 to even 20 years... Of course, once a person becomes a Dou Zhe then their training speed would increase exponentially. If one can only raise one Duan Qi in a year before becoming a Dou Zhe then that same person could probably go up a couple of stars in a year once after becoming a Dou Zhe....
When the training speed was slanted towards later times, Xiao Yan’s performance in half a month was surprising to say the least.
....
Walking out of the bowl without hesitation, Xiao Yan looked back at the lighter green liquid in the bowl. The lighter color was definitely due to his training and he helplessly shook his head while whispering: "Can this sustain for another month and a half?"
Wiping off the remaining water droplets, Xiao Yan randomly put on a fresh suit of clothing and crawled onto his soft bed. After doing so, he reached behind his pillow to take out the pitch black metal piece.
The rust on the steel piece had already been wiped off by Xiao Yan to reveal a smooth and glowing surface. It was quite mysterious.
For the past half month, Xiao Yan had been intently studying this metal piece that contained a Low Xuan level Dou technique whenever he took a break from training.
In the half month, under the instructions of Yao Lao, Xiao Yan finally had a bit of understanding of the techniques involved. But because of the lack of Dou Qi, he couldn’t use it for anything useful which made Xiao Yan a little disappointed.
......
Placing the metal piece between his two palms, Xiao Yan closed his eyes and used his soul perception to observe the black metal plate.
With the calming of Xiao Yao’s breath, the room was once again peaceful.
Another long silence passed before Xiao Yan opened his eyes again and raised his right hand. His right hand was curved into a claw and his light Dou Qi, under Xiao Yan’s insistence, quickly went through the few Qi and pressure points on his palm to become a pulling force.
"Peng..."
The ceramic vase that Xiao Yan pointed to made a few circles before falling down the tables. And with a clear crash, it shattered into countless pieces.
"Hah, even though the Dou Technique is at the Xuan level, my Dou Qi is too low and I can barely use the technique." Seeing the destruction that he had caused, Xiao Yan whispered to himself: "Looking at the power it has right now, if I want to have enough force to vacuum a person towards me then I need to be at 7 Duan Qi."
"Whatever, let’s go to our clan hall to find some lower level Dou Techniques. This vacuum hand, it won’t be of much use for some time. But since I can train my Dou Qi again, I don’t need to use my foolish method of training that I used before..." Sighing again, Xiao Yan climbed off of his bed and glanced at the motionless black ring before leaving the house.
Wincing his eyes and adjusting to the blazing sun, Xiao Yan carefully closed his door before lazily walking onto the stone path towards the clan’s back rooms.
To the sides of the stone path were emerald green willows. The bountiful green felt soothing and sharply contrasted with the scorching heat.
Turning onto a different path, a young girl’s laughter greeted him.
Because of the disturbed calm, Xiao Yan furrowed his brows and following the source of the laughter, he saw a couple of young girls coming towards him from another path.
Crowded by other girls, a pretty girl was laughing. The charming face that she had completely overshadowed the other girls beside her.
She was the girl that was second to Xun Er in the Dou Qi testing, Xiao Mei.
Glancing at the girl that had once stuck to his side calling countless biao-ges, a flash of unrestrained mocking went across Xiao Yan’s face. Lightly shaking his head, Xiao Yao retrieved his sight.
TL: Biao Ge is brother not in one’s direct family. This is a formal saying compared to ge-ge which is more of an familiar saying.
When Xiao Mei reached the road Xiao Yan was on, Xiao Mei’s charming laughter died out as she had seen Xiao Yan...
The sun scattered its light and made the impassive young man with his hands behind his head indescribably attractive.
A pair of pretty, large eyes stared at the young man coming closer, and trying to distinguish whether there was a light smile or ridicule hanging on the edges of his mouth, Xiao Mei mentally gravitated towards Xiao Yan. Suddenly, she felt as if she had lost something...
Three years ago, that young man, on the edge of his mouth, had that intoxicating curve.
