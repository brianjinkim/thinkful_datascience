Yun Che's consciousness gradually awakened. What's going on... How is it that I have not died? I vividly remember that I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff, how can I still be alive! Somehow my body is not in pain... And I do not even feel the slightest discomfort? How is this happening? Yun Che suddenly opened his eyes and quickly sat up. He found himself in a comfortably soft bed, with a red banner hanging above him, rendering a festive atmosphere. "Ah! Little Che! You... You woke up!" A girl's gasp of surprise was heard from his ear and the same girl appeared in his line of sight. At a glance the girl dressed in green looked to be fifteen to sixteen years of age. She was as fair as snow with charming rosy lips and a delicate nose. A touching look of deep surprise was expressed by eyes as clear and transparent as a pool of translucent spring water. Her face exuded a dazzling gentleness and softness. At this young age, she already exhibited such charm, so who can possibly imagine what sort of beauty she would be in the future? Staring at the nearby girl, Yun Che took a closer look and unconsciously let two words escape his lips, "Little Aunt?" The fair girl lifted her jade-like hands onto Yun Che's forehead and relaxed soon after. With a joyful expression, she spoke, "How delightful, your temperature is almost back to normal. You nearly scared me to death. Little Che, are you okay? Tell me if you feel uncomfortable anywhere." In the face of the girl's eyes that filled with deep concern, Yun Che woodenly shook his head. He stared openly into space with a vacant gaze. "Rest here for a while, I'll go and tell your grandpa that you're awake. Today is your day! When you fainted, your grandfather almost went crazy and personally went to find Doctor Situ for you." The girl was in such a rush that she did not notice the abnormality of Yun Che's current state. She pushed Yun Che's shoulders, signaling him to lie back on the bed and hurriedly left. As the door shut Yun Che sat up on the bed, hands clutching his head. This was one of the cities in the far east located in one of the Seven Empires of the Profound Sky Continent—Floating Cloud City. And he was the only grandson of the fifth elder of the Xiao Clan—Xiao Che! He had just turned sixteen this year. That was his current identity. Suddenly, his memory overlapped with the Azure Cloud Continent's twenty or so years of memory and he burst into confusion. If I am Xiao Che... Then why do I have memories of the Azure Cloud Continent? Is it because I traveled to this body after I died in the Azure Cloud Continent? No! I am obviously Xiao Che! This entire room is familiar to me and I clearly remember all the events of my childhood. Everything from my memory was from personal experience and there is no way I would steal another's memory! Then was everything from the Azure Cloud Continent all just a dream? Was it only after I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff that I truly woke up? But the memories of living in Azure Cloud Continent were as clear as day. How could those twenty-four years of love and hatred be only just a dream! What the hell is going on? Yun Che... The current Xiao Che stilled for a long time as he slowly calmed down and settled his thoughts. It was still early in the morning and the sky had not fully brightened. Today was his and Xia Clan's big wedding day. Two hours ago he was woken up by his Little Aunt and put on his red wedding robe. He ate the porridge his Little Aunt personally made and lost all the strength in his body. He did not remember anything that happened after that. He did not wake up until now. A strange smell came from his lips and Xiao Che's lips tucked slightly. His expression darkened. This is... Murdering Heart Powder!! In those years that he lived on the Azure Cloud Continent, with the Sky Poison Pearl in his body, Yun Che learned about all the poisons present in the entire world and it could be said that there was no poison he was not familiar with. He could identify a poison's name and effect with just a whiff. At the same time, because the Sky Poison Pearl, he was impervious. He could not be hurt by any poison, no matter how toxic it was. Murdering Heart Powder was made by combining a unique soul grass and the purple striae from a cherry-apple tree. If dissolved in water, the poison was colorless and tasteless. A person would lose his life ten seconds after the poison entered the body and no one would know the cause of death for it was also a traceless poison. Xiao Che's eyes clouded over and instantly understood what had happened. In fact, he did not really faint. Instead, he drank the porridge containing the Murdering Heart Powder and was poisoned to death! He was born in the Azure Cloud Continent but after he leapt off Cloud's End Cliff.... he was actually reincarnated in this world inside a dead body! If one were to hear this, it would sound like it was a fantastical story, but that was the only reasoning Xiao Che could imagine! Wait a minute.... if it really was like that, then this body should have no antitoxin ability. How come he was safe from the Murdering Heart Powder on his lips when the previous body's owner died not too long ago? A slightly strange feeling came from the palm of his left hand. Xiao Che lifted his left hand and was surprised to find that there was a circular green imprint on his palm. This shape, this color, this size.... was clearly the same as the Sky Poison Pearl! Before jumping off Cloud's End Cliff, he had desperately swallowed the Sky Poison Pearl but he did not actually know what would happen to him. This mark on his hand was unexpectedly the Sky Poison Pearl and it actually crossed over with him to this world! As if in a trance, Xiao Che stared at the Sky Poison Pearl and subconsciously whispered. "Sky Poison Pearl...." As his voice dropped off, the green mark on his palm suddenly released a green light. Immediately, a slight dizziness came over him and he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he opened them, his entire world was flooded in green. This world of green was wide and open. There were no boundaries to be seen and there was a faint aura of the Sky Poison Pearl throughout this space. After a long daze, Xiao Che understood, that he had entered the world inside the Sky Poison Pearl. Who would have thought that inside the Sky Poison Pearl, there would be such a wide and open world! What was even more unimaginable was that after he'd eaten the Sky Poison Pearl without thinking of the consequences, the Sky Poison Pearl had actually traveled along with him, and even seemed to have become a part of his body. If there was a way in, there had to be a way out. Xiao Che closed his eyes, and concentrated his thoughts. Suddenly, the world of green hastily dissipated, and when he opened his eyes again, in his vision, was the room he was familiar with. Staring at the faint green mark in his palm, Xiao Che slowly smiled... Even though it was not known why this ridiculous event occurred, not only had he reincarnated, but also retained memories from both lives. Maybe, even the gods couldn't watch the suffering of the two lives, took pity, and gave him a chance to live again! Yun Che was the victim of persecution from Azure Cloud Continent's countless strongest individuals. Although he died in the end, he shook the world by himself; how awe-inspiring and astonishing was that! However, his body right now, was only average... no, speaking without restraints, it could be considered the epitome of weakness. In the Profound Sky Continent, profound strength was most important. Although Xiao Che was born in the Xiao Clan, and was even the grandchild of the strongest Fifth Elder Xiao Lie, his profound strength was still at at the first level of the Elementary Profound Realm even though he was already sixteen. He started training when he was seven and half, entered the first level of the Elementary Profound at the age of eight, and then didn't improve for an entire eight years. He was mocked by all of Xiao Clan. Afterwards, Xiao Lie invited Floating Cloud City's top class doctor Doctor Situ to examine his body, and shockingly found that Xiao Che was born with damaged profound veins. The damage was so severe that it was almost impossible to recover from. In this state, Xiao Che would stagnate at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm, and could never improve further no matter how hard he worked. Even if he trained with his life on the line, he would stay at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm his entire life. This kind of person was unquestionably the lowest existence in the Profound Sky Continent, and was a total laughingstock within the Xiao Clan. If not for his grandfather Xiao Lie being the strongest in Xiao Clan, who also could even be said to be the strongest in the Floating Cloud City, no one would bat an eye against him. Xiao Clan was one of the three major families that trained in the ways of the profound in Floating Cloud City and has limitless strong entities. In the large number of youths coming forth from the same generation, Xiao Che could be said to be an unnecessary existence. Even if he died some day, not many except a few would care. But there were some today that actually tried to murder him using the extremely hard to obtain and expensive Murdering Heart Powder. Xiao Che clearly knew the reason why now. Because today was the wedding day between him and Xia Qingyue. Xia Qingyue, being the same age as him, was also sixteen. However, at such a young age, her profound strength was stated to have reached the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm, almost breaking out of the elementary level and stepping into the Nascent Profound Realm. She was the only one in a hundred years that had reached this level of profound strength at the age of sixteen in the Xia Clan. There were even rumors that if she continued to develop this way, she would be the first person in the history of the Xia Clan to ever step into the Earth Profound Realm a few decades later... or may even be able to reach the Sky Profound Realm that no one in Floating Cloud City had even thought of reaching in the past few centuries! More importantly, she was not only shockingly astute, but also extremely beautiful, and was considered to be the most beautiful girl by all of Floating Cloud City. All of Floating Cloud City's youths with some level of competency drooled over her. If the Xia Clan started looking for grooms, the line waiting would probably be long enough to stretch between the south and north gates of Floating Cloud City. This pinnacle of a girl with both intelligence and beauty in the Floating Cloud City, was actually marrying the generation's most worthless youth with no future at all. Who knew how many people were stomping their feet in anger and jealousy... This was wholly a case of a dazzling lotus flower planted on a pile of manure that no one would even bother to look at. The ones that had unrequited love for Xia Qingyue of course held both extreme jealousy and hatred towards Xiao Che. Even more were unwilling to give up... and would try to assassinate him by poison. As the current Xiao Che thought about it, this situation didn't seem to be bizarre at all. "Women are really the root of troubles." Xiao Che got off the bed, stood up, and soliloquized. But as he thought of the beauty and charm of Xia Qingyue that could tip over a whole city, he opened his mouth and laughed heartily, "Still, I get to marry such a bride, this really is a good beginning."
At this time, he was wearing a red wedding robe in a room plastered everywhere with "double happiness" red cloth. Last night, his grandfather Xiao Lie and his aunt Xiao Lingxi personally arranged this handiwork. His bedroom had been transformed into a wedding room. Suddenly, the door opened and an ethereal figure hastily came in. Xiao Che immediately stood up and smiled, "Little Aunt, is grandfather back?" Xiao Lingxi was Xiao Lie's daughter from when he was middle-aged. Although she was Xiao Che's aunt, she had only turned fifteen this year and was one year younger than Xiao Che. She was still quite young but her beauty was already charmingly touching. Her profound strength was at the early sixth level of the Elementary Profound Realm but even though she was not on par with Xia Qingyue if compared, it wasn't that bad since she was an important asset to the Xiao Clan and was held in high regard. "Oh, Che'er, you have finally woken up." A gentle voice spread across the room as Xiao Lie entered. Seeing Xiao Che already out of bed with a normal complexion, Xiao Lie relaxed a bit. Behind him followed his housekeeper Xiao Hong and the number one doctor in Floating Cloud City—Doctor Situ. "It's good that you have woken up and you do not look ill anymore but let Doctor Situ examine you. Today is your wedding day and we cannot have the slightest error. Doctor Situ, please go ahead." Xiao Lie stepped aside during his speech. Doctor Situ put his medicine chest onto the table and sat in front of Xiao Che, lifting his hands to finger the pulse on Xiao Che's wrist. After a while, he took his hands off Xiao Che. "Doctor Situ, how is Xiao Che's condition? Is it serious?" Xiao Lingxi asked worriedly, with fearful nervousness etched on her face. Although he did not speak, Xiao Lie appeared solemn and had a fierce look on his face.... How could he not be aware that Xiao Che's sudden collapse was strange? Doctor Situ's face slowly lit up and eased into a smile, "Elder Xiao you do not need to worry, your grandson's physical condition is excellent. He has no major ailments or even the slightest cold. Perhaps your grandson fainted because he was so nervous and excited that his blood rushed to his head. After all your grandson is marrying Xia Clan's daughter, the number one beauty in Floating Cloud City. Hohoho." Although Doctor Situ tried to conceal his contempt, his words revealed his regret. A talented woman marrying a useless good-for-nothing with no future was truly hard for someone to accept. "That's great news." Xiao Lie sighed in relief and nodded in thought, "It must be hard on Doctor Situ to be pulled over so early in the morning. Hong, escort Doctor Situ to the living room to rest." "It's fine," Doctor Situ replied with a wave of his hand and lifted his medicine chest, "Since your grandson is alright, I will take my leave. Congratulations to Elder Xiao on meeting Floating Cloud City's most outstanding grand daughter-in-law. I do not know how many people must envy you right now. Ha ha. Farewell." "You must remember to come to the wedding for a drink. Hong, escort Doctor Situ out." "Che'er, are you really alright? Do you feel unwell anywhere?" Xiao Lie was still not assured after Doctor Situ left and scowled in thought. When Xiao Che suddenly collapsed, his temperature dropped and his vitality faded away. This could not only be a result of being too excited. Looking at Xiao Che's present healthy condition, he indeed looked fine right now but Xiao Lie still could not shake off that small doubt deep in his heart. "I really am alright Grandfather, you can rest assured." Xiao Che said with an easy expression. His nose couldn't help but suddenly sour as he looked at Xiao Lie and he see a worried face with a head full of white hair. Xiao Clan consisted of five elders and although Xiao Lie was the Fifth Elder, he was the strongest in the clan. Five years ago he entered the border of the Spirit Profound Realm's tenth level. He was now at the peak of the Spirit Profound Realm's tenth level and had an opportunity to break into the True Profound Realm, a level that countless people dreamt of. Xiao Lie was only fifty-five years old this year with the strength of the tenth level in Profound Spirit Realm, but all his hair had already turned white. Every time Xiao Che saw this head full of white hair, his heart became bitter at the sight. The reason why Xiao Lie had white hair since his middle-age years was known to all the people living in Floating Cloud City. His only son, the father of Xiao Che, Xiao Ying was called the number one genius of Floating Cloud City. At the age of seventeen, he broke into the Nascent Profound Realm. At twenty, he reached the fifth level of the Nascent Profound Realm. At twenty-three he broke through the Nascent Profound Realm and entered the True Profound Realm, shocking all people of Floating Cloud City. He became the Xiao Clan's pride, as well as Xiao Lie's pride and joy. Almost everybody believed that when Xiao Ying became middle-aged, he would be the best candidate qualified to inherit the leadership of the Xiao Clan. Unfortunately, perhaps because god was jealous of the talented, there was an assassination attempt on Xiao Ying's life only a month after Xiao Che was born. A few days before that, Xiao Ying also saved the life of Xia Clan's daughter. After this rescue, Xiao Ying only could fend off the assassins with half his usual strength and drew his final breath. His wife's heart broke in grief for the loss of her love and went to meet him soon after. Xiao Lie's hair became white overnight due to the heavy blow of losing his son. Nine months later, Xiao Lingxi was born. Her mother also suffered from the tortured pain of losing her only son and died of depression a month later. Nobody knew how Xiao Lie lived his life the years after both his son and wife passed away. His pale white hair contained immeasurable grief, hatred and a deep unspeakable sorrow. To this day, Xiao Lie still had not found his son's murderer. Later on, he put all his hopes and wishes onto Xiao Che... But the brutal truth of him being born with damaged profound veins entered and left his life out of the blue like a bolt of lightning. However, facing his hopeless grandson, Xiao Lie never showed any signs of disappointment nor fury. In his point of view, being born with broken profound veins meant that fate had been unfair and that he should not be condemned because of such injustice. He should not be indifferent or ridicule Xiao Che but instead should love him more to compensate for it. Over the years, he had always been seeking any possible ways to repair damaged profound veins. However, profound veins were the lifeline of one's profound strength, how can it be so easily repaired? Although Xiao Che was ignored by others and was faced with the mocking eyes of others while growing up, he still felt lucky to have such a grandfather. Looking at Xiao Lie's piercing white hair, Xiao Che's eyes gradually sharpened... Since the gods gave me this second chance and let me have both my memories, even if it is to only comfort my grandfather, I have to live vigorously! So what if my profound veins are broken! I am a medical saint's successor; as long as I find the right medicine, in a short span of three weeks, I could fully restore my profound veins back to normal. "You're alright, that's wonderful to hear." Watching him, Xiao Lie was finally rest assured. Glancing at the brightening sky he spoke, "Che'er, the hour is nigh. Go make your preparations while I go arrange the wedding team... Oh right, do you want to ride horseback or sit in the carriage?" If he was yesterday's Xiao Che he would definitely have answered "the carriage". Although he was the only grandson of an Elder, without that status, he could be called a good-for-nothing with a world's difference between him and Xia Qingyue. On his bridal path to the Xia Clan, there was no doubt that he would suffer countless finger pointing and also bear numerous glances of envy and regret. One could imagine what feelings would surface if one met face to face in front of such negative emotion. Xiao Che laughed with a slight smile, "Of course I'm riding on the horse! You do not have to worry about me grandfather. Xia Qingque may be nobility, but she is already fated to be our Xiao family's daughter-in-law. I will openly wed her home with dignity and honor to not let you lose face." There was a delay in Xiao Lie's expression, for he would never have thought that his grandson would say such a thing. His face then broke into a gentle smile and he slowly nodded, "Good." With just one word, his deep satisfaction came through. Xiao Lie stepped out of the room and gently closed the door. As soon as Xiao Lie left, Xiao Lingxi stood in front of Xiao Che and curled her lips. Her face warped in unhappiness she spoke, "So you actually are excited for this marriage and made me worry for you in vain. You obviously have not met Xia Qingyue that many times but you are already fond of her... Oh right, she is our Floating Cloud City's number one beauty, huh!" Xiao Che quickly waved his hands back and forth, "How's that possible! Xia Qingyue is quite beautiful but I think Little Aunt is prettier. If I really fainted because of her, then I would not know how many times I would have fainted in this lifetime because Little Aunt always accompanies me everyday." "Hehe..." Xiao Lingxi's face immediately broke into a sweet smile as she giggled, "You know just the thing to say to make me happy. It's fine if Xiao Che fainted in his rush to marry her because Xia Qingyue is beautiful as she is talented. Xia Clan is also the wealthiest clan in Floating Cloud City so there is quite a lot of people who dream of marrying her. However, in the end, she is going to marry my family's Xiao Che." At this point, Xiao Lingxi wore a proud look on her face. Then her eyes became wistful as her voice gentled, "I feel like this day came so quickly... Little Che is already about to be married..." "Pound-pound," a knock on the door was followed by the voice of old housekeeper Xiao Hongcang, "Young master, it is almost time to go and meet your bride." "Ah.... already?" Xiao Lingxi glanced at Xiao Che's clothes and suddenly looked anxious, "Uncle Hong, wait a little while longer and we will come out right away." She walked in front of Xiao Che and a pair of soft hands began to quickly tidy his wedding clothes, "This outfit is quite hard to put on. Your clothes are in a mess because of the events earlier. Stand still, I will finish this right away." A pair of snow-white delicate hands began to work hurriedly. She flipped his collar back to the proper position and re-fastened his loose belt... Her actions were jerky but she took it seriously and paid careful attention to what she did. Xiao Che silently looked at her and his eyes gradually became misty.... Today he was going to marry Xia Qingyue but he knew for sure that Xia Qingyue was not marrying him because she sincerely loved him. If it weren't for their fathers; Xiao Xing and Xia Hongyi's agreement that March, Xia Qingyue would not even have bothered to take a glance in his direction. The only people in this world who were kind to Xiao Che were his grandfather, Xiao Lie and his little aunt, Xiao Lingxi. During his earliest childhood, Xiao Lingxi stuck to Xiao Che like a piece of candy. She followed him wherever he went and it was hard for him to shake her off. If she did not see him for a while, she would cry loudly. However, when Xiao Che turned ten years of age and it was confirmed that his profound veins were damaged, Lingxi seemed to grow up overnight. She knew the consequences of having broken profound veins and then understood the concept of her identity as his "little aunt". This started her regime of training in the ways of the profound to protect the life of the weaker Xiao Che. After the Azure Cloud Continent's twenty four years of "dreams", Xiao Che felt that his time here with Xiao Lingxi's kindness was as luxurious as it was precious. Although Xia Qingyue was about to become his wife, she would only be like the sky's coldest moon; something to only be seen but not touched. If I marry a girl like Little Aunt, it would be perfect... These kinds of thoughts uncontrollably popped up in Xiao Che's state of mind. After completing the complex motions of dressing Xiao Che, Xiao Lingxi let out a sigh of relief. Tippy toeing, she lifted her hand and tousled his hair. With an expression of tender affection clearly printed on her face, her pink lips slightly parted like petals of a flower. With a supernatural speed, Xiao Che instinctively tilted his head and pressed his mouth against Xiao Lingxi's lusciously pink lips.... 
"Ahh!!" Xiao Lingxi cried out and sprang backwards like a frightened rabbit. Her fingers touched her numb lips as her beautiful eyes widened in surprise and a touch of red quickly spread from her fair face to the nape of her neck, "You... You... You kissed me again!!" "You have the same reaction as usual." The innocent Xiao Che had a heartbroken expression on his face, "When we were younger, we always played your favorite kiss kiss game. These days, you go into shock every time I try to kiss you." "Y-y-you... You knew that was when we were kids!" Xiao Lingxi's face flushed into the color of a red rose, "We're now adults and cannot afford to mess around! You... You are soon to have a wife! In the future you can only kiss your wife!" "Why..." "Because I'm your little aunt!" Xiao Lingxi stomped her foot as she lost her breath. "Then.... What do I do if I want to kiss you?" Smiling mischievously, Xiao Che put his hand under his chin. The adorable fifteen year old girl before him didn't have the slightest bit of a "little aunt's" deterrence. "Then... You should marry me!" Xiao Lingxi turned her nose up in anger. "Hey! You're my aunt, how could I possibly marry you...." Xiao Che said with his voice lowered as his eyes widened. "Even you know that! If you dare steal another kiss, I'll let your wife know and let her handle you. Hmph! Xiao Lingxi looked at him triumphantly, with her nose in the air. Xiao Hong's voice came from outside once again, "Young master, are you ready? It's about time to go get the bride." "Yes, I'm coming out now." Xiao Che looked at his current outfit, and got ready to leave. After two steps, Xiao Lingxi grabbed his hand and said with a serious face, "Little Che! Before leaving, repeat the promise we made yesterday, word for word, or I won't let you go." Yesterday's promise? Xiao Che thought for a while and cannot help but say, "Alright.... after entering the marriage with Xia Qingyue, I won't forget about little aunt just because I have a wife. I'll spend the same amount of time with little aunt like before, I will listen to little aunt's calls and would arrive as soon as I'm called just like before... I don't think I forgot a word." "Hehe, what a good boy." Xiao Lingxi smiled sweetly but did not release Xiao Che's hand, "However, we will be adding another one today, the one I forgot yesterday.... Although Xia Qingyue is about to become your wife, in your heart she cannot outweigh me! Repeat that right now, hurry, hurry hurry!" Xiao Che gazed at her beautiful eyes and said, "If you kiss me, I will make that promise." "Then... marry me?" "......" Xiao Che was defeated. "Young master, are you still not ready?" It was forbidden to be past the "auspicious time". Xiao Hong's urgent voice came from outside again. Xiao Che put his hand on the door but did not push it open yet. He whispered, "I can't make that promise because in my heart, you are already my number one. Even if there are a hundred Xia Qingyue's, she cannot catch up to you. You are irreplaceable." As his voice faded, he pushed the door open and left. Xiao Lingxi stood still, frozen in place for a while. An arc formed at the edge of her lips and she joyfully skipped out afterwards, like a girl who had been given her favorite candy. As Xiao Che walked out of the room, his gorgeous wedding team awaited him. Xiao Hong kindly smiled at him, "Young master, please get on the horse. On the way I will be protecting you with everything I have.... But of course, today is young master's big day. I should not worry that much since there would only be good things that are waiting to happen." "Thanks, Uncle Hong." Xiao Che smiled at Xiao Hong and got on the horse. A gentle voice suddenly came from his left, "Looks like I came at the just right time. Is Brother Xiao Che going to retrieve his bride now? Felicitations." Xiao Che's eyebrows furrowed slightly at that sound and saw two young men slowly walk to his side. The person who spoke was a twenty year old young man of medium build. He was as handsome as he was elegant. His eyes were crystal clear on top of a refreshing face and he wore a bright smile. At his rear was a thinner younger man. His footsteps followed quickly behind the speaker. "Watching them, Xiao Che smiled, "Oh it is Brother Yulong and Brother Xiao Yang, did you guys specially make this trip here to see me off?" Xiao Yulong was the son of the leader of Xiao Clan. At the age of twenty, whether it be his appearance, talent, use of speech and wisdom, they were at the top of the young generation in the Xiao Clan. His profound strength had reached the third level of the Nascent Profound Realm at the moment. He was his father, Xiao Yunhai's, pride and joy and was also the future hope of the Xiao Clan. The clan had high expectations for him because he would become the next leader if no accidents should occur. He possessed many good qualities but he had never been arrogant. He was someone who was kind and polite to everyone. Even towards Xiao Che, who was considered to be disabled in everyone's eyes, he'd never mocked Xiao Che but instead was as gentle as he was polite. Not only that, he frequently expressed signs of concern when faced with Xiao Che's damaged profound vein problem. Xiao Che had always liked Yulong. He admired and appreciated Yulong's kindness.... Of course, those feelings came from the previous Xiao Che. The identity of the person behind Xiao Yulong was also not that simple. He was not just an ordinary Xiao Clan disciple; he was the Second Elder's youngest grandson, Xiao Yang. At the age of nineteen, he was at the ninth level of the Elementary Profound Realm. Ever since he was a child, he always followed Xiao Yulong around and listened to his every word. However, he wasn't as kind to Xiao Che as he was to Xiao Yulong. Even though they were both grandsons of Elders, he never cared for Xiao Che. Whenever Xiao Che tried to strike up a conversation, he would either ignore or respond with an upturned nose. As the grandson of a Xiao Clan Elder, not only did Xiao Che have his own residence, he also owned a separate little courtyard. Aside from his grandfather Xiao Lie, his little aunt Xiao Lingxi, and his sole best friend, very few people actually came to visit. At this time, Xiao Yulong came with Xiao Yang with the purpose of watching him go on his wedding journey. "Haha, of course." Xiao Yulong approached with a hearty laugh and said, "The person you are marrying today is our Floating Cloud City's number one brightest jewel. This is not only our Xiao Clan's big event, but is our Floating Cloud City's big event. Since you have the chance to marry this treasure, your brother here is very happy for you. Of course, I am also envious and ashamed as well. Hahahaha." Xiao Che also laughed, "Brother Yulong tells such a funny joke. With Brother Yulong's talent, the entire female population of Floating Cloud city is yours to pick from." "Young master, we must get going." Xiao Hong warned. "Brother Xiao Che, hurry up. We eagerly await for you to spectacularly bring in Floating Cloud city's brightest jewel into the Xiao Clan." Xiao Yulong said with a smile. Xiao Che nodded and immediately sat tight. The wedding escort team rode through the courtyard to the sound of the beating drums and gongs straight towards the Xia Clan Residence. The moment Xiao Che disappeared from sight, Xiao Yulong's smile froze and darkened. He suddenly turned around and fiercely slapped Xiao Yang hard in the face. In a low voice, he hissed, "Pathetic!" Xiao Yulong's slap was a direct hit and Xiao Yang's left cheek began to swell. He hurriedly scrambled at the foot of Xiao Yulong and fearfully spoke, " I... I clearly threw in the Murdering Heart Powder and the message I received confirmed that he did collapse... I... I also do not know what is going on here...." "Hmph!" Xiao Yulong's eyebrows tightened and distorted his face. "I spent so much money to get the poison that not even Doctor Situ has the cure to, but you screwed it all up! Don't tell me you want me to personally see Xia Qingyue marry that wastrel Xiao Che?" "Boss, that kid has only just left. We will have an opportunity on the wedding road... Although we cannot personally take care of this in fear of being seen, we can instigate a resistance force from the Yuwen Family and others. There are other men of nobility who covet Xia Qingyue. Just listening to people speak about Xia Qingyue's marriage to Xiao Che would make their teeth itch. If we encourage them a little and go out together, we would be able to...." "If it was really that simple, why did I spend so much time getting the Murdering Heart Powder!" Xiao Yulong coldly interrupted Xiao Yang and continued, "Xiao Che is a good-for-nothing but his grandfather is at the tenth level of the Spirit Profound Realm. Who would dare to offend him? Also, Xia Qingyue's father did not object to this marriage at all. Who would dare to openly offend the Xia Clan and Xiao Che? Even if the Yuwen Family's boys grouped up with the city lord's boys, their family would obviously prevent them from doing anything.... And didn't you see that old bastard Xiao Hong personally escort him? With him around, how could any trouble start?" While speaking, Xiao Yulong clenched his hands. The sounds of bone being dislocated popped in the air. The first time he saw Xia Qingyue, he thought that he encountered an angel and was already lost. From then on, he swore to make Xia Qingyue his woman in this lifetime. But Xia Qingyue, was actually going to marry Xiao Clan's most despised Xiao Che! How could he ever willingly accept that! "Boss, in fact... in fact you do not need to worry that much." Xiao Yang glanced at Xiao Yulong's facial expression and carefully spoke, "Think about it, with Xia Qingyue's temperament that never even bothered to glance at any of the talents in Floating Cloud City, would she even like that kid Xiao Che? The only reason why she is marrying Xiao Che is because of an agreement made sixteen years ago. If she marries into the family, it is absolutely impossible for Xiao Che to even touch her finger.... After she has entered our Xiao Clan, the chances of Boss meeting her would be greatly increased. That trash Xiao Che is not comparable to the Boss's natural handsomeness and talent. After a while, how could not impress that Xia Qingyue? By that time...." Listening to Xiao Yang's words, Xiao Yulong's gloomy scowl began to stretch while his narrow eyes squinted. He touched the tip of his nose with his finger and whispered, "You make a pretty reasonable point... looks like not being able to poison that wastrel to death can also be a good thing."
Floating Cloud City was the smallest city of the Blue Wind Empire. It was so small that it wasn't even suitable to be called a city; perhaps calling it a town would be more appropriate. Floating Cloud City was not only the smallest city but was also the most geographically remote in terms of location. The population, economy, and even the average profound strength was the lowest of the low. These days, Floating Cloud City's residents often mock themselves for being a forgotten corner in the Blue Wind Empire. Floating Cloud City was particularly lively today for it was Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue's big wedding day. Nobody would care if it was only Xiao Che's wedding but Xia Qingyue's marriage was Floating Cloud City's biggest sensational event. The Xia Clan was not a clan that solely trained in the arts of the profound. It was a clan that specialized in business for generations. Although they could not be said to be wealthy among others of the Blue Wind Empire; on Floating Cloud City's list of the most prosperous clans, Xia Clan was at the top. However, this did not mean that the Xia Clan was weak. With their abundant wealth, they could naturally afford to hire experts to protect their vast fortune. The leader of the Xia Clan had two children: Xia Yuanba and Xia Qingyue. Both his son and daughter had no interest in the family business. They solely focused on training in the ways of the profound. Xia Hongyi had never opposed their decision and instead allowed them to continue their path. After Xia Qingyue surprised Floating Cloud City with her talent, it was even more unlikely that he would prevent her growth. Due to Xia Qingyue's amazing god-given gift, Floating Cloud City's major families were on their best behavior in their presence.... After all, it was widely acknowledged that Xia Qingyue may reach the Earth Profound Realm or even the Sky Profound Realm someday in the future. At that point, the Xia Clan would not only have the most wealth, but would also be the most dominating force in Floating Cloud City. However, that Xia Clan had let the city's most brilliant girl marry Xiao Che, a good-for-nothing with no possible future. Who knows how many people regret that decision.... Of course, there were more people with feelings of envy and jealous hate. Since it was the Xia Clan marrying off a daughter, the spectacle was indeed not too shabby. As soon as Xiao Che went out, he saw a long line of red carpet that began from his door's entrance. This red carpet was the Xiao Clan's starting point and it extended in twists and turns towards the direction of the Xia Clan. As soon as the Xiao Clan's wedding team appeared, Floating Cloud City's street started to bustle with noise. The street was full with spectators on both sides of the street. As Xiao Che kept pace with the team, various whispers from the crowd entered his ears. "Look! That is the grandson of Xiao Clan's Fifth Elder. I heard rumors that his profound veins are damaged and he would never in his life be able to breakthrough into even the first level of the Elementary Profound Realm." "Oh, this is the first time I've seen him in person." "It's normal if you haven't seen him before. With such a stubborn bull for a grandfather and the fact that he is a good-for-nothing himself, would you even have the face to go out? Oh, for Xia Qingyue to actually be married to such a person, the heavens must really be blind!" "It is said that his father Xiao Ying and Xia Hongyi became sworn brothers when Xiao Ying saved Xia Qingyue's life after using most of his profound strength. Xia Hongyi then promised that on his daughter, Xia Qingyue's sixteenth birthday, she would become Xiao Ying's daughter-in-law. Not long after, Xiao Ying fell to an assassin. Due to his previous exertion, he was unable to fight back. The news hit Xia Hongyi like a meteorite and he felt extremely guilty.... Now that Qingyue had finally turned sixteen today and although Xiao Ying's son is a moron, Xia Hongyi was not willing to break his promise because of his heavy feelings of remorse and gratitude. If not for that, how could that guy even marry Xia Qingyue." "What! Xia Qingyue is our Floating Cloud City's greatest treasure. If he did not have his status of being the Fifth Elder's grandson, he could not even measure up to the mud on the floor. I am probably one hundred times stronger than him! This world is so unfair!" "The goddess of my dreams is about to marry such trash, I'd rather die than accept this fact! Ahhhhh!" The Xiao Che on horseback had bright serene eyes that conveyed a deep character. He had on an elegant expression and exhibited a light grace. His long hair fluttered behind his dazzling red wedding robe and his entire body emitted an air of elegance. The sounds of murmuring from the crowd contained all kinds of malicious undertones. However the envy, resentment, prejudice, ridicule, scorn, and disdain from the crowd seemed to not faze him at all. He seemed to be unconscious of the crowd as a beautiful smile was still plastered on his face. It was not known how many girls lost their hearts as their eyes misted over in adoration. Although Xiao Che's profound strength was the lowest of the low, his looks were actually not that bad. He could even be said to be beyond Xiao Yulong. Coupled with the fact that he rarely went out due to his low profound strength, he looked very white and delicate.... Just like a living doll! So even if the countless youths hated Xiao Che enough to make their teeth itch, in the depths of their heart, they also had to admit that he looked as if he was truly worthy of Xia Qingyue. "I thought that Xiao Che would ride in the carriage today but unexpectedly he is riding horseback. With that temperament.... it seems as if the rumors were not true." "Tch! The trash that people typically look down on is about to marry our Floating Cloud City's greatest treasure. Of course he should be proud! How could he be afraid of losing face?" rang a bitter voice. "I heard that Yuwen Clan's young master as well as other young masters from other families are taken with Xia Qingyue. Do you think they will come to stop this procession?" "Yeah right! Xiao Che is nothing but his grandfather is Xiao Lie. The experts of our Floating Cloud City all have to respect him in his presence. His son is already dead and he only has one grandson left. He tended to his grandson from the very beginning of his life. If anyone were to cause trouble, they would meet Xiao Lie's wrath! Whoever dares to do that will lose his head! Moreover this is not a forced marriage, who would dare to cause trouble to incur the wrath of the Xia Clan? I estimate that right now, all the lovesick youths who would actually disrupt the procession are firmly locked in their own house." The wedding procession went on in a casual manner, not too fast but not too slow. The journey of over five kilometers took nearly one and a half hours. "Brother-in-law!!" As soon as he saw the Xia Clan's main entrance, he heard a wild cry. A tall sturdy figure ran over to Xiao Che. This person was not that old, but he was at least two meters tall. His body was as strong as a bull and the ground trembled when he came over. As Xiao Che watched him approach, he gulped bitterly and spoke with wide eyes, "Yuanba! I have not seen you for only a month, how could you already have grown that much taller yet again!!" This man.... it was more accurate to call him a boy for he is Xia Qingyue's little brother, Xia Yuanba. He became fifteen this year... yes he was really only fifteen years old! However, if you take a look at his body, nobody would even imagine that he had just turned fifteen! Two meters tall.... Xiao Che on his horse was the same height as Xia Yuanba standing up. Yuanba weighed over one hundred seventy five kilograms. This number was definitely not that high because Yuanba was fat, but was instead because of his big strong muscles. His muscles were of a dark tan metallic luster and broadcasted his astonishing strength. His profound strength was only average, at the fourth level of the Elementary Profound Realm, but his physical strength was a force to be reckoned with. He could fight on par with those at the sixth level of the Elementary Profound Realm. Xia Yuanba was Xiao Che's best friend—his only friend. From a young age he had always called Xiao Che his brother-in-law, and they often played together when they were children. The days before he turned eight, Xia Yuanba was actually a dark and skinny child. He was often bullied but ever since he turned eight, it was like he ate something wrong and had an enormous growth spurt. His height, weight, and appetite all soared and the increase in his strength was absolutely stunning. Now at the age of fifteen... though his face had not fully matured since it was still quite childish, his size.... was of a monstrous proportion! After hearing Xiao Che's exclamation, Xia Yuanba rubbed his head in embarrassment, "This.... even I cannot help it. My father tells me to go on a diet everyday. However, letting myself starve and go hungry would be far worse than the feeling of being killed by another." "..." Xiao Che became speechless. At that moment he was only fifteen years old. Once he became an adult... he didn't dare to imagine that! Xiao Che knew that Xia Yuanba had a huge appetite. Fortunately he was born in the Xia Clan. If he was born in an ordinary family, his consumption would dissipate their entire fortune. "Hehe, brother-in-law, today you can finally become my brother-in-law." Xia Yuanba's smile was honest because he had been happily looking forward to this day. In his opinion, with such a strong sister for a wife, nobody would dare look down on Xiao Che. "Hurry up and come in, my sister is already ready." He slapped his head, "Oh, I'll go open the door." After that, Xia Yuanba turned in the direction of the Xia Clan entrance and ran like a mobile mountain of meat. The procession came in the Xia Clan's entrance. At the door, Xiao Che saw a smiling Xia Hongyi. He quickly dismounted and stood before Xia Hongyi. He respectfully greeted, "Uncle Xia." "Haha, after all this time you still call me uncle?" Xia Hongyi laughed. His stature was not tall for he looked like normal slightly overweight middle-aged man. Although if one were to look at him and the words "simple and honest" came to mind, nobody in the entire city of Floating Cloud would dare look down upon him. Xiao Che's eyes brightened and politely replied, "Father-in-law." He had always been respectful towards Xia Hongyi for Hongyi was the sworn brother of his father. From a young age, he suffered through the scornful glances of many people but Xia Hongyi had always tenderly cared about him. Even though he was born with a crippled profound veins, Xia Hongyi had never violated the agreement he made with his father; the agreement that Xia Qingyue would marry Xiao Che once she became sixteen. "Haha, good!" Xia Hongyi nodded. He reached out his hand and patted Xiao Che's shoulder, "Che'er, starting today, I will give Xia Qingyue to you. Although you are not a big hero, you are Xiao Ying's son so I can have a peace of mind when I give you my daughter. Your father Xiao Ying was an amazing man. Becoming his sworn brother is something I would never regret in this lifetime for he was a passionate and righteous man. You are Xiao Ying's son. Even though your profound veins are damaged, I do not believe that you will stay an ordinary person in the future." "Treat my daughter well. For those who talk nonsense and can only flap their mouths in malice, screw them all." Xiao Che's eyes smoldered in anger. He firmly nodded his head slowly, "Father-in-law, have no worries. Although people hold me in contempt now, once my profound veins are fixed, a sleeping dragon will be awakened from the abyss. I will make those people who look down on me and those who think that the Xia Clan took in a wastrel for their son-in-law obediently shut their traps." Xia Hongyi was surprised at his outburst.... He had always known Xiao Che to be weak-minded with a mild temper and an unconscious inferiority complex. Xiao Che's fearless utterance, sharp eyes and calmness made him see Xiao Che in a brand new light... one that was completely different from his previous attitude. "Good!" Xia Hongyi nodded and patted Xiao Che on the shoulder again, "I knew that Xiao Ying's son would not be an ordinary child. I will wait for the day this dragon surfaces. Alright now, Qingyue is waiting for you; go on."
Xia Qingyue appeared between the arms of two bridesmaids. She wore a red phoenix coronet on top of her head. A fine curtain of beads hung down from the phoenix coronet to completely cover her entire face while also hiding her current expression. Her soft and shiny black hair fell gently behind her shoulders. Her straight scarlet robe was decorated in the "four happiness" cloud pattern and the belt displayed her slender narrow waist nicely. On her belt hung a charm made of exquisite jade while pearls dangled at its tassels, matching her golden shoes. These significant details made her magnificent outfit even more dazzling than ever. Xia Qingyue slowly came to Xiao Che's side in the arms of the bridesmaids and every step she made was light and elegant, as if she were walking across the clouds. An ordinary person would look like they were walking but if they were in her body, they would look like a fairy riding on top of a cloud. Her usual posture was already that beautiful and Xiao Che saw such a feast for the eyes. Xia Qingyue finally came to the front of the carriage and the two bridesmaid walked away bowing backwards. In accordance to the Blue Wind Empire's wedding tradition, the groom would bring the bride onto the bridal chair. Xiao Che stepped forward and stretched out a helping hand at Xia Qingyue. Xia Qingyue elegantly lifted her hand... However, as Xiao Che took Xia Qingyue's hands in his palm, a piercing cold energy unraveled onto Xiao Che's hand and his entire right arm stiffened in pain, half-immobilized. The biting cold sensation slowly disappeared as Xiao Che put his arm down with a silent indifferent expression. Aside from a frown between his eyebrows when the icy cold hit him, he did not make any other expression nor the slightest sound. If one opened Xia Qingyue's curtain of fine beads, one would see her beautiful eyes flash in surprise and then hastily become cold once more. Xiao Che sat on the horse and the wedding procession went on with great strength and vigor. The Xia Clan's wedding team followed in the direction of the Xiao Clan shortly after. After another hour and a half, the procession returned to the Xiao Clan's main entrance. This long journey was smooth and calm, to the disappointment of those who looked forward to the development of any drama. Xiao Lie was already at the doorway and stood to welcome their guests. Sadly, the number of people who came for Xiao Che can be counted with one hand. Most of the guests came for Xiao Lie and the Xia Clan. With Xiao Lie's fame and Xia Clan's connection, many guests were seen. Outside the entrance of Xiao Clan house, people who came to see the event was next to infinite, the streets were so filled up that not even a water droplet could get through. All these people came for the marriage of the number one beauty in Floating Cloud City. Xia Qingyue's bridal carriage slowly stopped in the middle of the noise. A corner of the curtain was opened as her maid Xia Dongling gently spoke: "Miss, we have arrived." Afterwards, a hand reached out and Xia Dongling gently lowered her arms. As soon as she got out of the carriage, the deafening atmosphere suddenly quieted to replaced by deep breathes that followed one after another. It was almost noon. The soft sunshine reflected against her phoenix coronet while her robe charmingly glittered against the breeze making one's eyes blur if they look too long. Her hair was wrapped up high into a bun on top of her head and the phoenix coronet that framed her head was that of four layers. The top layer was adorned with fine golden hairpins while the bottom had several golden phoenix engravings. The satin red golden phoenix coronet extended into a fringe of swaying pearl tassels. Although her face was not laid bare, with her eyes and lips partly hidden yet partly exposed, her beauty was exquisitely flawless. The sound of irrepressible breathing overlapped against one another as many people stared straight ahead, unable to snap back into reality. That is the power of Xia Qingyue's charisma, for this all happened without the revealment of her face! Based on her aura and posture alone, she still seemed like a fairy that had walked out straight from a painting. Her beauty was so immense that none could take their eyes off her. Xia Dongling wrapped a red silk sash around Xia Qingyue's hand. Naturally, the other end of the sash was tied to Xiao Che's hand. As he got off the saddle, Xiao Che smiled as he walked over to lead Xia Qingyue across the brazier. They cruised over the doorstep of the Xiao clan and stepped directly into the hall. As they entered through the main entrance of the Xiao clan, the noise did not abate. Xiao Che's expression did not change as he kept pace but he naturally wanted the wedding to end as soon as possible. This was Xiao Clan's center hall for important meetings. The only people who were allowed to use this place for a wedding are the leader of the Xiao Clan and it's Elders. For this wedding the room underwent a large scale transformation. It was truly a vision that should be seen. As far as one could see, the pillars were all embedded with yellow topaz and the walls had been painted with dragons that were inlaid with rare precious pearls. A red carpet spread across the center of the hall in a straight line and stopped at a short golden staircase. A subtle golden light filled the atmosphere, making the already beautifully decorated hall more dazzlingly eye-catching. The Xiao Clan was not willing to invest such a large amount of money for Xiao Che and mostly came from the Xia Clan. Xia Hongyi was willing to spend as much as needed for his darling daughter's wedding. Xiao Lie and Xia Hongyi sat on the highest seat of the hall, smiles plastered all over their face as they watched Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue enter. On both sides of the red carpet were three rows of rose sandalwood chairs, all already filled with people. Xiao clan's leader, Lord Xiao Yunhai was there as well along with the other four Elders of the Xiao clan. As Xiao Che walked in with a happy smile, their expressions stilled on the surface but in the depths of their heart, they sneered in disdain. The Xiao Clan was a clan that practiced in the ways of the Profound for many generations. To have Xiao Che with a crippled Profound Vein born in the clan was a shame for the Xiao Clan. If he were not the grandson of the Fifth Elder, Xiao Lie, he would have already been expelled instead of remaining inside like he was now.... And if it weren't for the fact that he was about to wed the high-profile daughter of the Xia Clan, they would not even have bothered to show up in person let alone be present at the scene. Regarding Xiao Che, if they hear his name, they could only think of the word "trash" and not pay attention for they do not even remember how he looked like. In the Profound Sky Continent, one did not deserve dignity if one does not have the skill to back it up. It was a harsh reality and a universal truth followed by many, even towards members of the same clan. The expressions on the faces of the younger Xiao generation were unsurprisingly consistent as well. They all had their sights on Xiao Qingyue and their eyes belied their insuppressible infatuation. As their eyes transferred towards Xiao Che, their eyes almost erupted with naked envy. The Xiao Clan's outer disciples had always looked down on this permanently disabled person and never in their dreams thought that he would actually marry Floating Cloud City's unattainable number one treasure. The uncomfortable feeling that those two people in the marriage hall evoked was similar to eating dead flies raw. The person in charge of the wedding was logistics manager Xiao De. The wedding ceremony began at the cry of his voice. The master of ceremonies first introduced the bride and groom and then read names from a list of distinguished guests that have came to visit. As he went on, Xiao Che's expression remained neutral but in his heart were clashing waves of water. Whatever else the master of ceremonies said after that was something Xiao Che could not bother to listen to for he was repeatedly ruminating over a problem that he actually care about. What was that sudden weird feeling he felt at Xia Clan when his hands met with Xia Qingyue's? Was it some kind of Profound power? But he had never heard of such a mysterious power in Floating Cloud City. For Xia Qingyue to reach the 10th level of the Elementary Profound Realm at the age of sixteen was truly an amazing feat.... but she was still at the lowest point of the 10th Elementary Profound Realm; how was it possible that she could soundlessly release such an ice cold aura that actually completely immobilized his entire arm? What was that astonishing mystifying power which was displayed at such a level? Or.... was this the hidden strength of the Xia Qingyue who had reached the pinnacle 10th level of the Elementary Profound Realm? The voice of the master of ceremonies stopped. After a brief pause, his voice became eight octaves higher: "First bow to heaven and earth!" Xiao Che's mind rapidly rotated as he glanced at Xia Qingyue through the corner of his eye while bowing in the direction of the doorway, to the heavens and earth. "Second bow to the elders!" The two people made an 180 degree turn towards the seated Xia Hongyi and Xiao Lie and bowed. Xiao Lie firmly nodded and smiled lovingly at Xiao Che and his new granddaughter-in-law. Xia Hongyi also smiled and beamed in content. "Husband and wife, exchange bows!" Xiao Che's body turned towards Xia Qingyue and at the same time Xia Qingyue also turned to face him. This swift action that did not withhold any hesitation nor delay made all members of the younger generation of the Xiao Clan clench their teeth. In their thoughts, they believed that Xia Qingyue did not willingly enter this marriage with that crippled bastard but was instead forced to come by the Xia clan. To their disappointment, even up to this moment, there was no resistance at all from Xia Qingyue. There weren't even rope lines of her supposedly failed escape that they imagined to have happened. The two people bowed and as they both bent towards one another, Xiao Che saw cold eyes peeking through the gaps of the bead curtain.... cool icy eyes that revealed no traces of emotion. Usually at moments like this, the crowd would burst into enthusiastic applause, loud laughter and cheers. But only a few people authentically clapped for the married couple, it was quite awkward. "Indeed the Fifth Elder should be congratulated." The First Elder Xiao Li who was sitting next to Xiao Yunhai said with a cynical strangeness in his words. "I congratulate you in representation of all the Five Elder's well wishes." Even the First Elder Xiao Li who was sitting next to Xiao Yunhai heard the strange cynical scorn in his words. Second Elder Xiao Bo laughed with the same strangeness that came from the leader of the Xiao clan earlier and slowly continued: "Fifth Elder, getting such a talented granddaughter-in-law has added glory to the Xiao Clan. As for the Xia Clan getting such a son-in-law, haha, is also quite acceptable. Congratulations." The atmosphere in the hall immediately cooled. If one were not an idiot, they would clearly hear the apparent irony in the words "congratulations" that came out of their mouths.
When Xiao Ying was alive, Xiao Lie's position in the Xiao Clan was second to none for even the leader of the Xiao Clan at that time was respectful towards him. There was a clear reason; Xiao Ying's talent at that time gave him the potential to be one of Xiao Clan's strongest experts in the future. In this world that respected those with power, as Xiao Ying's father, Xiao Lie was held in high regard. However, after Xiao Ying's death, Xiao Lie's only grandson was born with a damaged Profound Vein. Although he was the strongest in Floating Cloud City who would fear him? His son was dead, his grandson disabled, and he had no other successors. His position in the Xiao Clan was now suffering a disastrous decline. Xiao Lie did not get angry for he had already become accustomed to these cynical jabs of wordplay. With an indifferent smile, he spoke: "Thank you all for personally coming today. Be sure to drink more than a few cups of wine to celebrate this event." "I have already given you face by personally coming here today so I do not need any wine. My grandson Xiao Chengzhi has now reached the 7th level of the Elementary Profound Realm. I have been here for quite a while now, I must personally go stabilize him." Third Elder said as he stood up. "Chengzhi has already reached the 7th level of the Elementary Profound Ream? To be only seventeen and have such success, his future is truly limitless. No wonder you were positively glowing today, that is surely gratifying!" The other four Elders rose to congratulate him with a surprised look on their face. Although well disciplined, Xiao Lie's face had a look of condensed anger. His four brothers had always showered him with respect but ever since Xiao Ying's death and the confirmation of Xiao Che's damaged Profound Vein, their attitude changed for the worse. Basically, they do not bother to show respect for him anymore. They typically bragged about their own grandsons in front of him but now, in his own grandson's wedding hall, they still fearlessly flaunted their own grandson's achievements. His brothers used their own grandson's success to rip out the deepest scars in his heart. All of a sudden, the atmosphere that could make one sweat bullets shifted. The master of ceremonies, Xiao De, hurriedly tried to speed up the wedding process and exclaimed in a squeaky high voice: "The bride and groom, go into the bridal chamber.... distinguished guests, please go to the banquet. In the midst of the sound of gongs and joyful drumbeats, the couple who many were watching finished their rituals of worship and started to walk towards Xiao Che's small courtyard. The bridal chamber was the room where Xiao Che usually lived in. It had been decorated entirely in red. The carpet on the floor was finely embroidered with a dragon and phoenix that flew upon clouds, an auspicious symbol for a blissful marriage. The room full of red silk also contained a large "double happiness" sign and two red candles were shining brightly between a golden lamp. The dragon and phoenix engraved on the candle seem to sway in the twinkling light. The flickering candle touched upon golden glaze curtain and seemed to fill the room with a dreamy hazy color. It was isolated from the outside world and gleamed in such a way that would make one's eyes soften. Xia Qingyue's maid, Xia Dongling, escorted Xia Qingyue to sit in her bed and then soundlessly stepped out of the room while closing the door. The room became silent and they could only vaguely hear the soft sound of their breathing. Xia Qingyue sat there quietly, soundless and motionless. Xiao Che did not approach her but instead stood near the doorway and stared past it with a shadowy look in his eyes. "Your grandfather was disrespected during your own wedding, you must be really upset, right?" A soft clear voice entered Xiao Che's ear and his expression changed. Although Xia Qingyue's words stung his ears, she left him in awe for she took the initiative to talk to him. Xiao Che glanced to his side and hesitantly spoke: "You can take down that phoenix coronet now. That thing is too heavy and if you wear it for too long, it would become uncomfortable." According to the wedding traditions of the Profound Sky Continent, the groom must take off the coronet for the bride. A while back, as he was trying help her off the carriage, she stung his hand with her mysterious cold aura. Xiao Che was too prideful to touch her again because he was fearful of that happening again. Besides, he did not think the cold Xia Qingyue would even be willing to accept his offer if he were to actually try to help her with her coronet. After a slight pause, Xia Qingyue raised her hands and silently took off the phoenix coronet. At that moment, a beautiful breathtaking face appeared in Xiao Che's line of sight. As she raised her charming eyes and meet Xiao Che's in contact, he immediately became stunned.... A pair of indescribable magnificent eyes met his. It was as if the world's essence laid deep within her eyes. Not even the world's most brilliant painter nor the most precious of words could accurately portray her beauty. Her jade-like skin and creamy face was as white as snow under the dim lights in the room. Her lips were like the world's most delicate petals and her nose was of the most beautiful of sculpted white jade, high and proud with an innate nobility. "You reputation precedes you." Xiao Che murmured, measuring her with his unblinking eyes. A pair of beautiful eyes peered back at him. An endless gravitational abyss drew his every attention and thought, making it difficult for him to move his eyes elsewhere. Although this was an arranged marriage decided since they were born, aside from the occasional glimpses he took when he was young, this was actually the first time he truly saw Xia Qingyue since the age of ten. This was because Xia Qingyue rarely left her home and the disabled Xiao Che had low self-esteem that evolved into an inferiority complex. He only heard about Xia Qingyue from the hearsay of others and after hearing that Xia Qingyue had grown up to become a peerless beauty, he pictured her in his heart. The shadowy figure in his illusions faded as he looked at Xia Qingyue realizing that he was in the face of true beauty. Xia Qingyue's allure was beyond his imagination for he could not describe this peerless beauty. The Xiao Che with clear memories of two worlds could not help but forget his thoughts when faced with such a sight. Xia Qingyue was called the number one beauty in Floating Cloud City but if anyone were to say that she was the one number beauty in Blue Wind Empire, Xiao Che would not dispute that claim. He could not think of anything that would surpass this beautiful spectacle before his eyes. The girl in front of his eyes was yet only sixteen; girls at that age have not fully blossomed but it is impossible to imagine what would happen to Xia Qingyue after a few years..... perhaps she would reach a transcendent level by that time. A girl whose every movement and smile that could move the world was born in little Floating Cloud City. And this girl has become his wife today.... Xiao Che could not help but question the authenticity of his reality. "And you are not what the rumors say nor what I had imagined as well." Xia Qingyue rose and her touching curve of her body was exposed as she approached Xiao Che. Her eyes shone like water as she slightly parted her lips: "Rumors say that your vein was disabled so you can only stay at the 1st level of the Elementary Profound Realm. Because of that, you have a weak physique and low self esteem since you only stay at home. Your only friends are your little aunt Xiao Lingxi and my younger brother Yuanba. The only thing on your body that can be regarded as an advantage would be your appearance." "Your Profound aura is not only weak and murky but your Profound Vein is indeed disabled. However, your personality is completely different from what the rumors claimed you to be." Xia Qingyue stopped at a distance of three steps before Xiao Che as she stared straight at Xiao Che with her beautiful eyes: "Although you deliberately hide and pretend your true character, I sensed your arrogance ever since I laid my eyes upon you. You are completely the opposite of those rumors. Earlier at my place, I froze your hand with my Profound power but your calm reaction surprised me. If your hand wasn't so still, I would have doubted that I failed to use my power. In the wedding hall you and your grandfather Xiao Lie were mocked during such an important occasion but it only looked like you were angry for a quick second and then your anger disappeared. Your expression and heart rate showed no signs of abnormal fluctuations at all. It is difficult to achieve that mental state of mind even for a middle aged Profound Spirit practitioner!" "When you look at me, there is an obsessed glint in your eye that has not diminished even now." "Your disabled Profound Vein is fact but your true personality and state of mind has fooled everyone." Xia Qingyue whispered, as her boundlessly deep eyes stared at Xiao Che. Xiao Che startled in surprise. With Xia Qingyue that close to him, one would usually be in ecstasy when in the presence of the perfume of her floral scent but Xiao Che could not be bothered to be moved by that. His heart had completely went in shock as he stared back at her in awe. It was true, he was indeed a proud person regardless of who he was in the presence of because back when he was in the Azure Cloud Continent, he was one of the proud warlords there. Anyone living in Floating Cloud City at the moment was not on par with those legendary warlords of his time. Although his strength went through an extreme decline, his state of mind stayed the same. He did not deliberately set out to appear that way but it was the natural attitude of his previous life. However, he had to keep his prideful self hidden because of his current lack of strength and situation. What Xia Qingyue said had perfectly described his personality in one go! On the road from Xia Clan back to Xiao Clan, he always thought that she held him in contemptuous disregard for she was a heavenly treasure and he was the mud on the floor that people despised. It was a typical common thought. But he had never been aware that she had been watching him during their journey back. Xiao Che suddenly saw Xia Qingyue in a new light as he looked into her extremely beautiful eyes. Those clear eyes that saw through his mind and heart in meticulously fine detail left him in shock. You know! This Xiao Che with two memories of experience was a person that could not be moved in the face of all the world's heroes and even in the face of death! Yet she already saw him through! Was she really only a girl who had just turned sixteen!? How can this sixteen year old girl possess such a monstrously keen eye and mind! Xiao Che had a suspicion that maybe Xia Qingyue was like him, a person reincarnated into this world! "Are you enduring it?" Xia Qingyue asked after a pause. "Enduring it?" Xiao Che let out a seemingly self-deprecating laugh: "Perhaps. The truth of my damaged Profound Vein won't change. In the Profound Sky Continent, living a life with a disabled Profound Vein has made people look down on me like I am the scum on the bottom of their shoe. Is there a difference between a cowardly self-blame and a silent endurance? Enduring it? More like he was tolerating it! Yesterday's Xiao Che was exactly as what the rumors had said he was! No matter how clever Xia Qingyue was, she could not have thought that today's Xiao Che would have another lifetime's worth of memory. His temperament and mental state had also changed along with it. Xia Qingyue's beautiful eyes narrowed as she suddenly lifted the jade-like palm of her hand and stretched out two fingers to touch his chest. Suddenly, a cool but not entirely cold aura hit Xiao Che in the chest and spread throughout his body. As Xiao Che was about to ask her what she was doing, the cold feeling instantly disappeared and Xia Qingyue opened her lips that were like the soft petals of a flower: "Your Profound Vein is indeed disabled, but it is not a congenital deformity. You were probably attacked when you were very young and someone directly destroyed your Profound Vein!"
"Was destroyed?" Xiao Che frowned. Ever since he was a child, his grandfather and everybody else all said that he was born with a damaged Profound Vein. He even believed that himself when he got his memories of "rebirth" back since his memories included the mastering of all the medical books in during his lifetime. But Xia Qingyue said he wasn't born with a damage Profound Vein but instead it was damaged by an external force. In truth, no one in the Xiao Clan had been able to see through this guise. Xia Qingyue had only looked at him within a few breaths of time and to her, that fact was as clear as crystal. This woman.... "Yes." Xiao Qingyue creased her eyebrows and gently spoke: "It was heavily damaged during your childhood and your family did not notice. Because of that, it was never repaired and now that you have already grown up the damaged Profound Vein has fully formed into it's disabled state... and lost all hopes of repairment!!" Xia Qingyue said that last statement with absolute confidence. If an adult's Profound Vein became damaged, their power would leak but there were a variety of methods to repair that. However, if the Profound Vein broke in the early stages of infancy, the growth of the vein would start from a bad foundation and will only become worse. At Xiao Che's age, the vein had already become badly shaped so it was impossible for it to be repaired back to normal. Xiao Che's expression did not change and simply said: "That may not necessarily be true." Xia Qingyue gently inclined her head to glance at him: "Looks like you always had the notion of repairing your Profound Vein?" "I'll definitely fix it." Xiao Che said blankly. Xia Qingyue looked at him deeply. She saw not only confidence and arrogance but a deep layer of coldness in his eyes. She sighed in her heart and softly spoke: "The Profound Sky Continent is a big place with numerous amounts of talented people, perhaps there really may exist a person who can repair your damaged vein. I should not have said what I had said earlier with such assertion, you can just take it as my ignorance. In those few words, Xiao Che's impression of her improved dramatically. He hesitated, then asked: "The icy cold power you used earlier, what was that? I have never heard of anyone in Floating Cloud City with that skill. Your master is not a person from Floating Cloud City, am I right? Of course, it's up to you whether or not you want to tell me. Xia Qingyue was silent for a while and right when Xiao Che thought she would not answer, she calmly replied: "Frozen Cloud Arts." "Frozen Cloud Arts?" Xiao Che slightly shivered at the name as he felt a vague sense of familiarity. When he suddenly remembered the name of the concept, his paled and words uncontrollably escaped from his mouth: "Frozen Cloud Asgard !?!?" Xia Qingyue tilted her beautiful head and looked at Xiao Che with a surprised expression. When he shouted out "Frozen Cloud Asgard", Xiao Che had already lost his cool but in her eyes, he was still too calm. Even if the Lord of Floating Cloud City heard that name, his body will weaken and his legs would tremble in fright. She lightly said: "My master is indeed from Frozen Cloud Asgard so I can be regarded as a disciple of Frozen Cloud Asgard.... This fact, the only person in Floating Cloud City who knows of that is my father. You are the now the second. I tell you this.... because you are my husband now and this is the most basic of my respect for you." "......" Xiao Che's racing heartbeat could not calm down. The words "Frozen Cloud Asgard burst into his heart like a huge bomb. Because it was the most powerful out of Blue Wind Empire's four major Sects and also the holy land of that many yearn and long to be in. Even the Blue Wind Empire's royalty must worship their transcendent existence annually! Heavenly Sword Villa, Frozen Cloud Asgard, Xiao Sect, Burning Heaven Clan. Out of the seven countries in Profound Sky Continent, the Blue Wind Empire was currently the smallest. Although they had the lowest overall strength, they have never been annexed by the other countries. A large part of the reason why was because of those four major sects. Those powers that be are not afraid of the Blue Wind Empire's strength but instead fear the four major sects. There is no doubt about the strength of those four major sects. The process in which they recruit disciples was very strict and they did not care about background in their selections. The most important thing they want in the end was talent. Everyone living in the Blue Wind Empire dream and aspire for that kind of great fortune. If you get into one of these major sects, even the lowest of disciples will bring honor and prosperity to their family. They would even be the guests of honor at court and be presented with the rank of a marquis. No one of this little Floating Cloud City had ever heard of anyone being admitted into one of those major sects and no one would even dare dream about it. If the previous Xiao Che heard the names of the four major sects, it would be like hearing the existence of the heavenly sky kingdom. He would never have expected to be touched by those words.... but he did not expect that the wife he had just married was one of the disciples of the top ranked sect, behind Heavenly Sword Villa, Frozen Cloud Asgard! Xiao Che quickly calmed himself down and asked: " Since you are one of Frozen Cloud Asgard's disciple, why don't your family reveal it to the public? With your identity, Xia clan can freely walk through anywhere in Floating Cloud City and nobody would dare offend them. All the rich people, including the city's main clan will seek to curry favor from you. The growth of your Xia clan will also develop at a rapid pace." "Because of you." Xia Qingyue answered. "Because of... me? Xiao Che stilled in silence... Those three words had reminded him why. "I married you with the identity of a girl from Xia clan and the entire city of Floating Cloud is in an uproar. If I married you with an Frozen Cloud Asgard's disciple's status, not only our small city of Floating Clouds would be in an uproar. No matter what, there would be a lot of unpredictable consequences between you and my Xia clan. After all, the difference between you and I is far too vast." Xiao Qingyue said in a light voice with clear eyes. Although she only stood there silently, she was already brilliantly dazzling. Xiao Che slowly let out a sigh: "Then why did you marry me?" "You know precisely why.... My life was saved my Uncle Xiao Ying. I am the reason why he died during an assassination attempt soon after. Since I was born, my father arranged a marriage between us in order to repay Uncle Xiao Ying's kindness. Although it was my father's promise, I have no reason to disobey him and thus I have no reason to not marry you." Xia Qingyue raised her glittering cold eyes: "The reason why I told you that I belonged to Frozen Cloud Asgard was to let you know that in order for me to continue to practice the Frozen Cloud arts, my heart must be like a frozen cloud. Frozen Cloud Asgard only accept women and they must be pure and uncontaminated for life. Although I did marry you, I cannot love anyone in this lifetime. You must understand my commitment." "......Even if you aren't a disciple of the Frozen Cloud Asgard, I don't think you would fall in love with me anyway." Xiao Che said with a self-deprecating smile. Xia Qingyue slowly shook her head: "Maybe you have misunderstood me. I have never despised you nor have looked down on you.... My master had told me many times that people of a higher level should never overlook someone else. Nor underestimate them. Besides, I have just reached the starting point of my journey up. The Profound Sky Continent respects the strong so there are countless doctors around. Just because your Profound Vein was broken does not mean that your life is completely ruined." Xiao Che was moved. Floating Cloud City bragged about Xia Qingyue's beauty and talent but perhaps nobody knew about the elegance in her state of mind that not even the countless number of middle-aged people in this world can achieve. And she was really only sixteen......after a few years, one could not imagine how she would be. No wonder she caught the fancy those from Frozen Cloud Asgard ! This woman with such beauty, talent, and mind of a fairy had really just became his wife not too long ago! It felt like that was only just a dream! If he did not have two lives worth of experience and memory, he would feel a sense of inferiority and could probably not even muster up the courage to look her in the eye. "Thank you for telling me this..." Xiao Che said with a passionate sigh. His eyes then became focused as his voice changed: "Then, can you tell me the level of your current profound strength? Entering the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm at the age of sixteen was talent amazingly enough to stir the entire city of Floating Cloud. However, Xiao Che did not believe that Xia Qingyue was only at the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm anymore. Because this unrivaled level of talent in Floating Cloud City should not catch the eyes of those of Frozen Cloud Asgard. Xia Qingyue became silent and did not answer Xiao Che's sudden question. However, her silence had indicated that her strength was higher than that of the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm. "You should go to the toast." Xia Qingyue slowly replied with a glint in her eye. As her voice fell, the sound of slow footsteps came from outside the door. Xiao Hong's old gentle voice came from the door: "Young master, it is time for you to propose the toast." "Grandpa Hong, I'll be right there." Xiao Che promised. With one last look at Xia Qingyue and after patting his clothes of any dust, he walked out of the room. As soon as Xiao Che left, a bright ice aura surrounded the room and a white figured dreamily appeared in front of Xia Qingyue. Xia Qingyue lightly stepped forward and spoke with a gentle and respectful voice: "Master." "Qingyue, do you wish to return to Frozen Cloud Asgard with me?" The beautiful gentle voice was as misty as a cloud and as gentle as a breeze. It was enough to make even the world's coldest heart completely melt. Xia Qingyue gently shook her head: "Master, Qingyue intends to stay a while. If I leave as soon as I got married, he will suffer even harsher of endless ridicules. I ask master to give me a month's time so I won't hurt him nor allow others to make fun of him by the time I leave." The woman dressed in white looked at her. After a while she nodded slowly and smiled faintly: "Alright. It is the first time in hundreds of years that a Frozen Cloud Asgard disciple was allowed to be married. Since it had been an exception, another month's worth of wait is nothing." "Thank you for fulfilling my wish, Master." Xia Qingyue's body lowered again as she hesitantly whispered softly: "Master, is it really impossible to repair his Profound Vein?" The woman in white shook her head without delay: "There are no such things as absolutes in this world.... but at least to me, it seems to not be possible. Qingyue, it is good that you are a kind and compassionate person with a giving heart. However, I really cannot help you with this issue."
Xia Qingyue did not ask again. Since even this white-robed woman with such high pedigree and exalted status was sure that it was "not possible", then there should not be even the smallest chance of it being possible. "Qingyue, I know you are eager in repaying your debt of gratitude since your life was saved at a young age, to even go as far as delaying your return to Frozen Cloud Asgard, but you marrying him should already be enough to repay that obligation. When you return to Frozen Cloud Asgard, your identity will be revealed. Although he may suffer more ridicule after your departure, his status of being the husband of a Frozen Cloud Asgard disciple would still be intact. At least in this little Floating Cloud City, with that kind of prestigious status, no one would dare to cause him physical harm." The lady in white said with a comforting tone of voice. Xia Qingyue softly nodded: "I hope so." "His Profound Vein is disabled and he also has no other strengths. He will never be able to achieve any accomplishments perhaps in his entire life. But you are beautiful and smart. Talents of your nature are born once every hundreds of years. Otherwise, our Mistress would not have let you break the rules like that and get married. Marrying you was his greatest fortune and luck in his entire life. You taking this step is justice enough. If his father was still alive and smart enough, he would have cancelled this wedding... I have to go. I will pick you up a month later. During this period, I will not go anywhere far. If you encounter any unresolvable problems, write me a letter to keep me informed." "I bid teacher farewell." The white robed woman's chin turned around. Suddenly, a beautiful face with a hint of coldness on it was seen. She wore no make up for her skin was as smooth as a snow white piece of jade. People cannot help but think of the terms "a beauty with flesh of ice and bones of jade" and "a face of snow with lips of pearls" to describe her as they laid their eyes upon her. Her facial features were as exquisite as they were perfect. She was charming in a way that made people unable to even dare look at her. One would think that she was as holy as she was lofty when gazing into her eyes. She was like a fairy who had ascended above Nirvana, untainted by anyone of the human realm. She opened the window and her body slightly trembled. As if accompanied by an invisible cold ice spirit, she looked as if she had dissolved right at the place she once stood. Xiao Clan Main Hall, a full Guest House. "Seventh Uncle Liu, please have a drink." Xiao Che respectfully presented a cup in front of a gentle looking middle-aged man. The person who was called Seventh Uncle Liu stood up as he started to laugh. He raised his cup and drained it of its contents. He spoke with laughter: "My nephew, I was best friends with your father, now that I see you have formed your own family and have married to such a good wife, my heart is happy for you." "Thank you Seventh Uncle Liu." "First Elder, please have a drink." Xiao Clan's First Elder Xiao Li took the cup and gulped the entire mouthful. He then heavily slammed the cup of wine onto the table. During this entire process, aside from saying "hmph" through his nose, he did not say a single word nor look Xiao Che in the eye. Even with that attitude, drinking Xiao Che's cup of wine had already expressed the large amount of face he gave Xiao Che. Xiao Che did not speak as well and moved to the next table. Just as he walked two steps, Xiao Li spit on the floor and opened his mouth as he spoke in a cold harsh tone of voice within Xiao Che's hearing range: "Such a delicate flower has now been inserted into poop. Bah!" Xiao Che's expression remain unchanged. His consistent footsteps had not paused and it was as if he had not heard him. That was only if one did not look closely, for his eyes hardened and a deep cold condensation hid behind them. He came over to the Second Elder, Xiao Bo's side. Xiao Che bowed slightly: "Second Elder, Xiao Che offers you a cup." Xiao Bo did not bother to look Xiao Che in the eye but he opened his mouth to lightly say: "Yang dear, help me drink it." "Yes, Grandpa." Xiao Yang said without hesitation. He took Xiao Che's offer of wine and drank it all, only making a "guru" sound. A cup of wine presented to an elder but drank by his children did not show only contempt anymore. It was a sort of public humiliation. After drinking the wine, Xiao Yang put the cup down and sat back on his seat, his eyes filled with undisguised scorn and ridicule. Xiao Che did not say anything again. He only nodded slightly and moved on to the next table. Just like before, as soon as he took two steps, a cold grunt was heard: "Hmph, trash is trash. Even if trash climbed into Xia Clan, it is still trash. Xiao Lie that old bastard is actually going to depend on his granddaughter-in-law? Bah!" The voice contained deep disdain, sarcasm, and of course jealousy. Even if one did not mention the wealth of the Xia Clan, if one can still brag about Xia Qingyue's amazing talent. If she had not been married to Xiao Che but instead to his grandson Xiao Yang, his laughter that came from his dreams may actually become audible. Xiao Che pretended to not have heard and walked away smiling. Xiao Che finished his toast and sent out the guests. The long night of banquet was over. During this entire process, the people who displayed genuine heartfelt congratulations and best wishes were so few that Xiao Che could count them on his ten little fingers. Countless people were very polite towards him, after all today was his wedding day, but he clearly saw contempt in almost all of their eyes. Some people sighed, some people were jealous with anger. The rest had unconcealed scorn and other negative thoughts like "trash" and "worthless" written all over their faces. His Profound Vein was disabled so it was a fact that he would not achieve any greatness during his entire lifetime because of that. So they don't have to be friends or be polite with Xiao Che. They did not care if they offend him because even if he got offended, he could not do anything against them with his disabled Profound Vein. Before this wastrel they could be unscrupulous and not care, readily dripping in the show of their superiority. They felt strong as they look down on this person who would never become anything but one who was weaker than them. That is the ugly reality of human nature. "Take an early rest." Xiao Lie patted Xiao Che on the shoulder with a gentle smile on his face. Xiao Che did not know what was hidden under his grandpa's smile at this time. As Xiao Lie became older and older, his temper had become more and more gentle. But when he was young, he was like a candle that could easily be ignited. If someone made him upset, he would make that person ten times angrier and no one dared to provoke him. Xiao Che knew all too well that his grandfather's temper did not become soft due to old age, but was instead because of him.... In order to protect his useless grandson, he had to become kind and soft. Even if they were looked down upon, as long as the bottom line had not been crossed, he would endure it as best as he could. This way, there wouldn't be any enemies that would come back to get revenge on his grandson after he had passed away. As the most powerful person in the Floating Cloud City, the Fifth Elder that everyone used to be afraid of, was now not respected nor feared by the other Elders anymore. This was true in the case of the younger generation as well. Watching Xiao Lie's back, images of disrespectful and laughing faces appeared in Xiao Che's mind. Xiao Che clenched his fists slowly as they gradually became pale. His eyes sharpened and radiated an image of an ice-cold blade. Subsequently, the corner of his mouth slowly opened and revealed a smile that would make one's hair stand on its end. Xiao Che was definitely a vengeful person. As someone who held long grudges, in the last six years in Azure Cloud Continent, his heart that was filled with hatred remembered everything. He remembered everyone who had been nice to him but also all the people who had not been nice as well. He kept it in deep in his heart... until it was time to seek revenge for even the smallest of grievances. "You guys will.... be sorry...." A deep guttural noise slowly overflowed from Xiao Che's mouth like a vicious curse. Since God gave me this chance to be another person, how could I let my Grandfather and I suffer through this bullying! Back in his little courtyard, the moon was still hanging high against the sky. Xiao Che walked to the corner of his yard and stretched out his left hand. Suddenly, water arrows shot out from his palm. During today's wedding, he could not avoid drinking a lot of wine. In the end, he drank so much that it looked as if he could barely stand on his own. In reality, he was actually clearly awake. This was not him having a high capacity to hold his liquor but was instead because of the Sky Poison Pearl. All the wine he had drunk transferred into the Sky Poison Pearl. Since the pearl had become one with his body, he manipulated it as if it was like his own body. The sound of 'hua lala' was heard for a long time until all the wine had been removed from the Sky Poison Pearl. Xiao Che lifted his wine-covered left hand and smirked. He rubbed the wine directly onto his face and held his breath until his face turned red. Stumbling, he pushed his bedroom door wide open as he wobbled to his left and right, as if he was drunk. The door was pushed open and the smell of wine followed Xiao Che as he staggered into the room as if he were about to trip any second. He awkwardly lifted his head and looked at Xia Qingyue. Xia Qingyue sat on the bed with her beautiful eyes closed. It was extremely quiet. The dim candlelight flickered across her beautiful soft face, adding a bewitching mystical feel that one could not possibly resist. Xiao Che's eyes brightened and his feet shook as he walked towards Xia Qingyue: "Hehehehe, my wife... I have let you wait for a long time... let's go... we can now... use the bridal chamber..." Xia Qingyue suddenly opened her eyes and casually waved her right hand. An irresistible cold force suddenly swept up Xiao Che and pushed him out of the door. Xiao Che fell on his bottom and had almost knocked over the stone table in the courtyard. Xiao Che was in pain and rubbed his butt. It took him a lot of effort to get up and then he angrily roared: "Damn! I was only joking, you don't have to be so ruthless! I am so feeble yet you hit me as hard as you could... anyone would think that you are planning to murder your husband." The door slammed. Xiao Che pushed forward but discovered that the bedroom door was firmly shut. Xiao Che suddenly became depressed... This woman, don't even even speak of flirting, even jokes are taken so seriously! Can I really live happily this way? "I was really only joking... Besides, I am only at the lowest 1st level of the Elementary Profound Realm. Even if I wanted to do something to you, that would be impossible." Xia Qingyue did not respond. Xiao Che stood at the door for a long time but the door showed not the slightest sign of opening. Xiao Che's small courtyard only had one housing. There was no point in mentioning if he had other rooms for he did not even own a work house nor a stable. If it was a normal day, he could sneakily slip into his little aunt's place to sleep. But tonight was his wedding night, so it was not appropriate for him to sleep anywhere else. As a cold night wind passed by, Xiao Che shivered and it looked as if he had become smaller. He knocked the door again and weak spoke: "Hey, you're not really letting me sleep outside, are you? You should know that there are many people in the Xiao Clan who would want to lay their hands on you. They are very upset that tonight is our wedding night. They have realized that someone as talented as you are, would not let me touch you even if we are married, so they must be waiting for something to happen for an excuse to laugh at me. If they come over and see that I was locked outside, I would forever become a laughing stock." "No matter what, I am still your husband. Do you really have the heart to helplessly watch me get laughed at?" The room was still completely silent. Right when Xiao Che had the notion of kicking the door, the closed door finally slowly opened. Xiao Che rushed in as quick as lightning and shut the door with a bang. Xia Qingyue remained in bed with the previous attitude from before. Although she was just sitting on the bed, she emitted a hazy noble elegance. Her beautiful eyes slightly turned, looked at the flustered Xiao Che and spoke in a faint voice: "You are not allowed to be within five steps from me." "..... Then where would you let me sleep?" Xiao Che rubbed his chin. The room was small; it only had a bed, a reading table, an eating table, and two cabinets. If one walked from east to west across the room, at most there would only be the size of seven of eight paces of distance in between. "You sleep on the bed." Xia Qingyue stood up from the bed. "No need!" Xiao Che flatly refused and sat in the corner furthest away from Xia Qingyue and closed his eyes. Although Xia Qingyue was perhaps a hundred times stronger than him, his dignity as a man refused to let a girl sleep on anywhere but a bed if he had a choice.
He had married such a beautiful wife yet on his wedding night, he could not touch, caress any part of her body, or even sleep on his own bed. He could only silently hug his knees as he leaned against a wall in the corner of his room... Xiao Che now had really felt the maliciousness of this world. The red candlelight reflected against this newly transformed room, making it seem lovely. The two people in red dress entered a long silence, one sat at the edge of the bed and the other huddled pitifully in the corner. The only sound heard during this dragging silence was the vague sound of their breathing. After a while, Xiao Che finally could not help but say: "You will not....really make me stay here all night? Xia Qingyue's long eyelashes fluttered and the graceful curve of her body turned slightly to lie down on the bed. She released the scarlet curtain and it fell, hanging down. Xiao Che could only make out her vague blurry shadow under the dim candlelight. Suddenly, Xia Qingyue waved her hands and a cold windy breeze extinguished the two red candles simultaneously....making Xiao Che sit in the dark shadows of the room. "......" If it wasn't impossible for him to beat this woman, even though she was as cold as her appearance, he still would have jumped her. "I was just joking earlier. Not only am I not drunk, I did not even drink one sip this entire afternoon.... You can't even take a little joke, you have no sense of humor." Xiao Che resentfully muttered. "I knew you weren't drunk." Xia Qingyue replied coldly: "But I really hate men who could defecate and urinate anywhere." Defecate and urinate... anywhere? Could it be... when he was trying to get the wine out of the Sky Poison Pearl? Fuck!! Xiao Che's eyes widened as he jumped up from his corner: "You said that I indiscriminately urinate anywhere? Which eye did you see that with! You only heard the sound of me pouring wine! Pouring wine... pouring the wine! As a dignified man of the Xiao Clan, I would never do something as uncultured and filthy as that. You are allowed to look down on my Profound power but not insult my noble character and personality!!" A little white after Xiao Che roared at her, he heard the leisurely sound of Xia Qingyue's voice: "I was only joking too." "Damnit... " Xiao Che had almost vomited out his blood. Depressed, Xiao Che went back to his corner and became silent again... This woman really knew how to joke around!! Usually he would sleep comfortably in his bed but on his wedding night, he had to sleep in a corner... There was no way he could fall asleep! After holding in for a long time, Xiao Che let out his voice again: "So, when are you going back to Frozen Cloud Asgard? Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow?" Xia Qingyue: "!?" Xiao Che laughed with a light expression and calmly explained: "Although I know very little about the ways of Frozen Cloud Asgard, I do know that they only accept women. Emotions of love are forbidden and they all have to be chaste. There are countless beautiful women in Frozen Cloud Asgard and I have never heard of anyone there getting married. But you married me. Looks like even among the people of Frozen Cloud Asgard, your talent and gifts are a rarity. You are perhaps a talent that they have only seen once in hundreds of years. Otherwise, why else would they break such a precedent in your favor?" Xia Qingyue: "......" Xiao Che raised his head and looked up at the darkness of his ceiling and continued: "For someone like you, they would do all they can to recruit you into their Frozen Cloud Asgard in the shortest time possible. There must be countless strong practitioners that study the way of the Profound that an ordinary person would never see in their entire lifetime, and countless treasures as well. Under these circumstances, your Profound power and status would sky rocket. You are probably going to leave soon, am I right? Xia Qingyue remained silent for a long time. After a while, she answered in a vague voice: "In a month." "A month?" Xiao Che's surprised expression became a smile as he lowered his head and whispered: "Thank you." Xia Qingyue: "?" "You must have asked them for this month. I doubt that Frozen Cloud Asgard would willingly let you delay your recruitment and let you stay with a useless person like me against your wishes. One month is quite a long time and you are their treasured talent. In the future, you may even reach the same level and even be on par with the Mistress of Frozen Cloud Asgard. Others may laugh at me, mock me, and never put me in their eyes, but someone like you who would improve to unimaginable lengths in the future, was willing to marry me. You tried to protect and maintain the pride of a laughable man like me... Although I know you are doing this to repay my late father's kindness, I thank you just the same." "No need." Xia Qingyue answered unemotionally. But her heart slightly shifted inside her as she became slightly moved by what he had said. He was not wrong at all, for even her master told her that talents like her were as rare as can be even in Frozen Cloud Asgard. Her master even said that once Xia Qingyue entered Frozen Cloud Asgard, she was confident that she could breakthrough the Profound Spirit Realm and even reach the Profound Earth Realm... A level that not even the number one practitioner in Floating Cloud City, Xiao Lie, could reach. Reaching the Profound Earth Realm before the age of twenty... To the people of Floating Cloud City, that was an unimaginable feat. "Before I married you, I thought you would be like all those people who hold me in contempt and ignore me, but you are better than I thought you would be. Not only are you beautiful, you are also talented and kind. As a woman, you can be considered to be flawlessly perfect. Xia Qingyue: "......" "Well, since you are so kind, you certainly won't let your husband sleep in the corner on your wedding night, right? My bed is quite large and it definitely would not be crowded if two people slept on it...." Before Xiao Che even finished his sentence, a cold and murderous aura blew across the room and he shivered. "If you keep talking rubbish, I'll throw you out!" Xiao Che crooked his mouth and obediently shut up as his stiff bottom bitterly went back to where he sat before. "Somebody's here." Xia Qingyue suddenly exclaimed. After a while, Xiao Che heard the soft faint sound of footsteps. If he did not deliberately try to hear it, he would never have noticed those footsteps. The owner of those footsteps seemed to have suddenly stopped in front of his courtyard. The careful footsteps stopped right in the middle of the courtyard and went no further... because in the room was the untouchable Xia Qingyue. After sneaking around the courtyard for what seemed like half a day, the owner of those footsteps left as quietly as they could, the same way they quietly snuck in. It was night and Xiao Yulong could not sleep. He looked out his window with a frantic expression on his face from time to time. The door opened and Xiao Yang's hurried footsteps had come in. Xiao Yulong narrowed his eyes and asked: "How is it?" "This..." Xiao Yang carefully looked at Xiao Yulong's expression and spoke with great care: "I just came from Xiao Che's place, Xiao Che seems... to not have been locked out." "......" Xiao Yulong's hopeful expression dropped off his face. Xiao Yang's heart thumped and he hastily said: "But you don't have to worry Boss. Xia Qingyue even views the guys from the governor's mansion and the Yuwen family with a contemptuous disregard, how could she even like that Xiao Che of a wastrel. Although he had not been driven out, it's probably because... because she pitied him. She probably does not want him to get laughed at.... although he is in the same room as Xia Qingyue, I doubt they are lying on the same bed. He's probably laying on the ground right this minute... that must be it. Xiao Yulong's dark uncertain face cast his eyes in the direction of Xiao Che's courtyard. He clenched his fists: "Xia Qingyue is the woman I want, and no one can meddle in my affairs! I will personally check out what had happened. Absolutely do not let him touch Xia Qingyue !!" "Yes!" Xiao Yang quickly answered. The small dwarf-like Xiao Che who was rolled up in a ball was still awake in the corner of his room in the middle of the night. He opened his eyes and raised his left hand to look at the center of his palm. In the darkness, there was a striking faint green light that came from the Sky Poison Pearl. In Azure Cloud Continent, with only the power of the Sky Poison Pearl, he alone stirred the world's wind and storms, but also incurred the wrath of the entire Azure Cloud Continent... However, this had almost used up all its poisonous power! The Sky Poison Pearl had fused with his body to become a part of him, and he could hardly feel the presence of its usual toxicity. Before his death on his killing field, he had used the Sky Poison Pearl's power to slaughter many strong practitioners. He had overdrawn the Sky Poison Pearl's power and its poisonous powers ran dry... Overdrawing and exhausting are two different concepts. If exhausted, it could slowly recover. However, overdrawing directly depleted the source of the power, making it perhaps, virtually impossible to restore it to its original strength. Today's Sky Poison Pearl only had the most basic of detoxification, refinement, and fusion capability... of course, its storage remained as well. With his Profound Vein disabled and the Sky Poison Pearl's strength depleted, he would never be a viewed as an important person in this small little city. The most intolerable fact was... that he did not even have the ability to consummate his marriage with his own wife! If he wanted to have strength, the most basic step he should take would be first to repair his destroyed Profound Vein. Repair his Profound Vein... Xia Qingyue was certain that his Profound Vein could not be restored in ways an ordinary practitioner would use. But for him, this was not an impossible feat because he was the successor of a medical saint! His teacher had told him many times of the healer's theory in medicine. When in the face of a problem, one must remember that there is cause and effect. If there is a problem, there must be a solution. If there are people suffering, there must be healers. In this world, there is no incurable disease and if people say there one, it was only the healer's own lack of ability. Regarding how to repair his Profound Vein, Xiao Che had been thinking about that to this very day. His Profound Vein had not been an inborn disability, but was damaged by another at birth. After growing up, his Profound Vein has now been thoroughly crippled, making him unable to even use the most conventional of methods to restore it. In order to destroy his old disabled Profound Vein and recultivate another, he needed at least three things... "Wife, are you asleep yet?" Xiao Che asked. After a long period of silence, he still did not receive a response. "Cough cough, wife you aren't really asleep right?" Xiao Che asked again. "My name is Xia Qingyue!" Xia Qingyue replied in a cold soft voice. "I know your name is Xia Qingyue." Xiao Che scratched his eyebrows and strangely asked: "Wife, I have something to ask you." "Call me Xia Qingyue!" She said in anger. "Oh, okay!" Xiao Che nodded. With a poker face on, he asked: "Wife, after you go to Frozen Cloud Asgard, are you able to obtain the Seven Profound Gem Grass, a Purple Veined Heaven Crystal, and a beast core of the Earth Profound Realm? Are you able to get a hold of those three things?"
The three things Xiao Che asked for made Xia Qingyue pheonix-like eyes instantly open: "What are you trying to do?." "Does this mean you actually have a way to get your hands on them?" Xiao Che asked hopefully, after seeing that Xia Qingyue had not immediately outright rejected him. Xia Qingyue slightly furrowed her eyebrows, and started to slowly speak: "I have never heard of a Seven Profound Gem Grass but a Earth Profound Realm beast's core can only be obtained after killing the beast. And how many people in the Blue Wind Empire could actually successfully hunt a beast training in the ways of the Profound? Even in Frozen Cloud Asgard, one who could do that would certainly be quite rare. And a Purple Veined Heaven Crystal is a priceless immortal treasure that even the Four Major Sects would go crazy for! Even one would be worth more than ten years of a person's lifetime cultivation. Those three things, don't even mention me, even if it was the Mistress seeking those things, it would still be almost impossible to obtain." Xiao Che's chest heaved up and down as he closed his eyes, silent for a long time. "What are you planning to do with those three things?" Xia Qingyue asked spontaneously. "Repair my profound vein." Replied Xiao Che. "...I am unable to help you." At the same time, Xia Qingyue said that, she did not believe that those three items could repair a profound vein. Otherwise, there was no way her master would not know this method. Xiao Che shook his head as if it did not matter: "Those three items are not things that an ordinary person could obtain, I was only casually asking about them." After a small pause, he spoke again in a little small voice: "Wife, after you return to Frozen Cloud Asgard, will we ever meet again?" "Do not call me wife again! My name is Xia Qingyue!" Xia Qingyue said as her voice pitched higher and her voice got colder. Indifferent, Xiao Che spoke in a carefree tone: "I married you and you married me. We have already bowed in the face of heaven and earth with thousands of people as our witness. We have also went through the entire wedding process. I am now your husband and you are my wife. If I don't call you wife, what else would I call you?" "......" Xia Qingyue became speechless. After a while, she indifferently spoke: "Whatever, suit yourself." Xiao Che suddenly grinned broadly... this wife was untouchable, but had no conversational skills! "You still haven't answered my previous question... When you return to Frozen Cloud Asgard, will we meet again?" Xiao Che asked again. "No." Xia Qingyue replied. "Good!" Xiao Che nodded his head and leaned his head against the wall as he closed his eyes: "In fact, you should return to Frozen Cloud Asgard as early as possible and not have to worry about me. For someone as talented as you are, you should not stay in this little Floating Cloud City and also not be tied down by me. When you leave, your status of being a disciple of Frozen Cloud Asgard would become public. At least in this Floating Cloud City, no one would dare to hurt me and I would live more comfortably... Oh right, you should not have any objections about my opinion?" "....As you wish." Xia Qingyue said, expressionless. "Mmm, this is more like it, since you would never see me again. If you do not let me get a concubine, I might really divorce you." The forgiving Xia Qingyue's heart was as calm as water but she had a spontaneous urge to kick him out of the room. At the same time, she suddenly saw Xiao Che stand up and walk to the door. She hurriedly asked: "Where are you going?" "Can't sleep, I'm going out to watch the stars." As Xiao Che answered her question, his heart groaned... This woman, how about you squat down here in the middle of the night. Let's see if you can sleep that way! Xia Qingyue did not speak anymore and Xiao Che opened the door as he proceeded to walk outside. It was in the middle of the night and all was still. Standing in the middle of the courtyard, Xiao Che looked at the sky full of stars with a determined expression in his eyes. However, deep inside, he was at a loss with an unsettling and perplexing unease. Today was the first day he had been reborn. Although his mind had changed greatly if compared to the past, with a change that could even be said to have turned the world upside down, even his strong mind could not find a way to get out of his current damaged Profound Vein situation. If he could obtain the Seven Profound Gem Grass, Purple Veined Heaven Crystal, and the core of an Earth Profound Realm's beast, he would have more than a 50 percent success rate when repairing his Profound Vein. However, with his current ability, to even get one of the three items he needed as prohibitively difficult. After all, only the strong were respected in this world. Without enough power, achieving what one wants was but only just an illusion. What was he suppose to do... Suddenly, a slight throbbing sensation came from Xiao Che's left hand. He subconsciously raised his left hand and saw impressive glimmers of rapid flashing faint light come from the Sky Poison Pearl's pattern in his palm. Xiao Che's eyes contracted as he turned around, facing north. "This is...." In addition to being poisonous and having a strong refining capability, the Sky Poison Pearl had an additional ability. It had the special kind of ability that could sense nearby toxic medicinal herb ingredients! If within a certain distance from a highly toxic ingredient or drug, it would perceive where it would be, emit flashing light, and point in it's target's location... but it's prerequisite was that the material must be one of the highest of qualities. The level of sensing that the Sky Poison Pearl had was unrivaled. If compared, the highest level that a person could reach achieve would not even reach that of the Sky Poison Pearl's. On the Azure Cloud Continent, the Sky Poison Pearl had only flashed six times, each time letting him find the rarest of the most exotic treasures! Although this was its first day on the Profound Sky Continent, the Sky Poison Pearl actually had such an induction! Even this place hid a secret hidden treasure? The Sky Poison Pearl's targeted direction was to the north... which was the direction of Xiao Clan's mountain. Xiao Che had his own little courtyard, it's location could be said to be the most dangerous out of all the Xiao Clan's property. This is because over his courtyard walls, laid the mountains. This mountain was still actually the private property of the Xiao Clan. The occasional wandering low level profound beast would break into the courtyard by climbing over it's walls. And if one wanted to come from the back of the mountain and sneak in to make this area it's own, that would be a very good choice. However, in the face of the Xiao Clan's power in Floating Cloud City, no one has ever dared to have done that to this very day. Xiao Che did not hesitate and directly climbed over the wall. Although his profound strength was low, climbing over a wall of three meters was no problem. The mountain area was quiet and somber, and if it was the previous Xiao Che, he absolutely would not come here in the middle of the night. The moon in the sky was still hanging up high and the countless stars there were also not that dim. Xiao Che glanced all around him and when he was sure there was no one in sight, he tread softly in the direction the Sky Poison Pearl was pointing toward. The mountain under the light of the moon seemed to be shrouded in a thin layer of mist, making it seem both mysterious and dangerous. Not long after, Xiao Che arrived at the foot of the mountain. In this place, the Sky Poison Pearl's flickering light was at it's highest frequency. Xiao Che stopped and wondered... was it around here? But this was clearly only the foot of the mountain area. Xiao Clan pharmacists must pass through here everyday so how could it even grow here? Whether it be a heavenly treasure or a somewhat decent type of medicine, it would have been found already; why would it wait for him to find it for harvest. However, the Sky Poison Pearl had indeed reached this rapid frequency which meant that the target would be at least ten footsteps away. In the moonlight, Xiao Che's brow tightened as his eyes slowly and carefully searched every inch of the land around him. Under normal circumstances, the more precious the medicinal herb was, the more dangerous and extreme the place it grew would be. At first glance, this area at the foot of the mountain was covered entirely in weeds and Xiao Che could not help but be tempted to suspect that there was a problem with the Sky Poison Pearl's natural sense. As his eyes carefully scanned the ground in a circle, aside from only weeds, Xiao Che could not find even the most common of medicinal herbs. Right when he was about to give up, his eyes suddenly landed on a place with some kind of indistinct variety. The Xiao Che of today had a sharp intuition. He raised his head and looked in the direction of the uncomfortable feeling that he suddenly felt for the first time in this world. There was a mass amount of weeds there as well, but a certain weed at the edge of a rock that had not been trampled had caught his attention. Xiao Che walked to the rock's side and squatted down next to it and stared at the mass of weeds for a long time. Firmly locked in the middle of all those weeds were... smaller weeds with a tenacious amount of vitality. Without interference, one can say that they are clinging on to dear life by rooting at every opening available. In the middle of those untrampled weeds was an even smaller chasm. The hole was very small for only two blades of grass grew there. However, if one looked closely, it was apparent that the grass there was significantly different than that of the other weeds around them. A gust of the gentle night breeze blew by, swaying the small weeds in the area. At this time, Xiao Che's eyes had been firmly locked onto the small hole and suddenly saw the bizarre form of those two blades of grass... they appeared in a blink of an eye and then disappeared, without a trace. Xiao Che's eyes widened and he was suddenly filled with ecstasy. He quickly stretched out his left palm that contained the Sky Poison Pearl towards the little hole. Under the faint green light, the two blades of grass slowly appeared again. "Star Concealing Grass! It really is Star Concealing Grass! And there were even two of them!" Xiao Che excited growled in a low voice as he lowered his left hand with the intention of uprooting them. The Sky Poison Pearl flashed and the two blades of Star Concealing Grass were recovered, in the palm of Xiao Che's hand. The high quality the medicinal herb was, the harder it was to harvest for even the slightest mistake during harvesting may cause damage to the materials and lower it's efficiency or even complete destroy it's effectiveness. But with the Sky Poison Pearl, no matter how complicated the herb, one had no need to worry. The Sky Poison Pearl could harvest a herb without bringing any possible harmful side effects by using it's aura, completely wrapping around a herb without any sort of spiritual power leakage. "Instead of saying that it was a surprise, it's better to say that this was a miracle!" Looking at the two blades of Star Concealing Grass that were partly hidden in the palm of his hand, Xiao Che's arm quivered in excitement. In his entire twenty-four year life, he had traveled almost everywhere on the Azure Cloud Continent and only found one Star Concealing Grass. However, on only the first day that he came to the Profound Sky Continent, he had actually found two! And it was in his own family's back mountains! One could say that there was no difference when comparing the differences between a Star Concealing Grass and the common weed, for it was almost impossible to differentiate between the two even if one tried. At the same time, it had a very unusual ability... it could become invisible! In a way, it meant that if one wanted to find one, it would be even more difficult to do. His teacher had once told him that the Star Concealing Grass was an treasure of the heavens and earth, but there were few who knew of it's existence. The amount of people who had the ability to identify it were no more than five in the Azure Cloud Continent. In addition, the only thing in the world can could completely refine this heavenly treasure was the one and only Sky Poison Pearl! "This is truly the heaven's grace assisting me. Owning these two blades of Star Concealing Grass is equivalent to having a surefire trump card! After refining them into Star Concealing Pills, my life would be insured even if I wanted to kill or rob people... I could do whatever I wanted to!" Xiao Che laughed as he clenched the Star Concealing Grass in the palm of his hand and sent it into the interspatial storage within the Sky Poison Pearl. The flashing light that came from the Sky Poison Pearl stopped completely after he did that. The happy Xiao Che no longer had a reason to linger any longer and turned to go back home. As he was turning around, a cold light suddenly flashed in the corner of his eye. Xiao Che's stopped in his tracks to turn in the direction of the cold light. In the not too dim moonlight, he saw a vague blurry mass less than fifty meters north of him. It was an obscure white shadow. What was it?
If it was a normal person, even with a decent amount of Profound strength, one would still not dare venture forward in this scenario. But Xiao Che did not hesitate one bit as he walked directly toward that abnormal mass of white shadow.
As he gradually approached, he suddenly discovered that it was actually a person! A very quiet person was lying there!
"Who are you?" When he saw that the blurry image was that of a human, Xiao Che stopped walking and asked.
The silhouette did not respond and there was not even a single tiny bit of breathing movement coming from it.
Had this person fainted? Or had... died?
Who was this guy? Why did this person collapse here? Wait! If this person had fallen in the daytime, someone would have already come upon this individual. Yet it seemed as if Xiao Che was the first to discover this guy, which meant that this person had only appeared here just now... The earliest time would be after night completely fell.
Xiao Che did not hesitate and quickly walked closer.
As he came before the body in front of him, he stared at the figure while in a daze, under the moonlight.
This was actually a... girl!
The girl looked to be either twelve or thirteen years old and wore a messy dress. Her daintily cute and petite body was curled up like a frightened kitten. Below her skirt’s hem revealed two slender snow white legs but upon closer scrutiny, there was actually a distribution of little fine scars. She wore one black shoe on her foot, with the other shoe no where in sight. Her naked foot was like a delicate ice lotus and her exquisite toes were as clear and translucent as a jade carving.
The most striking detail on her body was her hair. It was unexpectedly like that of an evil demon’s uncanny bright red color! The cold flash of light saw in the corner of his eye was actually the reflection of her head.
A girl? How could a girl be here? And how could it be possible that she had that many scars on her body?
What was the reasoning behind her hair color? Did the Profound Sky Continent have people who were born with such red hair?
Xiao Che bent over and stretched out his hand to gently shake the girl’s shoulder: "Little girl, little..."
Xiao Che’s voice suddenly stopped after he cried out in surprise. As quick as lightning, he retrieved his hands back from the girl’s shoulders. This was because through her thin clothes, her body was completely cold, without the heat that a living person should have. The most shocking feeling of all was when he came in contact with the girl’s body, it emitted an extremely poisonous aura.
Yes! It was highly noxious... to a point that it scared him, for it was a kind poison that had the highest level of toxicity he had ever met, far exceeding that of all the poison knowledge he acquired from his past world! It was so terrible that once his hands came in contact, all the hairs on his body stood erect.
At the same time he backed away, Xiao Che startled in surprise yet again. The weed and vegetation around the girl under the presence of the moonlight was not dark because of the lack of light. It was not dark green... but rather a horrible black burnt color! Even the land around her had become a pitch black.
Xiao Che’s heart thumped in piercing terror. If it weren’t for the Sky Poison Pearl’s all purpose poison detoxification in his body, the instant he touched the girl’s body, he would have had already been poisoned to death.
In this world, how could there be such a terrible poison? The most malicious of all poisons, wasn’t that the Sky Poison Pearl? Even back in the days when I used the Sky Poison Pearl, it did not release such a horrible toxin! In fact, it was by far lower!
Could it be that in this world there is something even more poisonous than the Sky Poison Pearl?
How did this little girl have such a terrible poison within her? And why was she lying in this area?
Numerous doubts surfaced in Xiao Che’s mind but it was undoubtable that this little girl was dead. With this kind of severe poison, not even mentioning this little girl, even a strong Sky Profound Realm practitioner would die instantly.
Xiao Che took a deep breath and after a slight hesitation, he again put his hand on the girl’s shoulder and slowly turned her lifeless body over. Under the moonlight, the girl’s face appeared in his light of sight. He froze in shock as he looked at her, as if he had lost his soul, unable to return back to reality...
"How can there be... such a beautiful girl... ." Xiao Che’s soul let out an uncontrollable tremorous cry.
This girl was so beautiful, a monstrous beauty, so beautiful that she could probably steal souls. If he was not seeing her with his own eyes, he would never have believed that such a young girl could unexpectedly release such thrilling charm.
As red as a demon, a face of white jade, each of her facial features were all beautiful to the extreme and all of them combined together made her unbelievably perfect. Xiao Che could not find any words to describe this girl’s exquisite appearance. He was obviously looking at her from a close distance but in his heart, he felt as if she was an illusion come to life... because in his subconscious mind, he did not dare to imagine that there existed someone in this world who had such a perfect face.
Xia Qingyue was the number one beauty in Floating Cloud City and even in the Blue Wind Empire, there probably wasn’t anyone that could compare to her. However, when Xiao Che saw this girl’s face, he was stunned, as if his soul had been punched heavily. He never would have thought that he would be so strong effected to the depths of his soul by only a person’s face.
She only looked like twelve to thirteen at the moment. If she grew up to the age that Xia Qingyue was at... that would be simply unimaginable! Maybe then, she could cause chaos with only just a smile.
But such a beautiful girl was killed by a toxin that a poison expert like Xiao Che had never seen before, and she had died on the land of the Xiao Clan. Xiao Che could not figure out what poison it was and why it was here...he only felt that it was such a misfortune. It was unfortunate that this beautiful girl had been so brutally destroyed.
What kind of people would actually be cruel enough to have the heart to kill such a beautiful girl!
Xiao Che looked at the contaminated black vegetation and land around him. He hesitated for a moment but still ended up stretching out his left hand to press his palm against the girl’s cold chest. The Sky Poison Pearl then quickly started to detoxify the poison in her body. This was the Xiao Clan’s back mountain. Judging from the power of the poison in her body, if it continued to spread, the entire mountain could end up a dead mountain. Although the Sky Poison Pearl’s power had almost disappeared, it still had the ability to detoxify poisons. The Sky Poison Pearl in his palm continued to shine, purifying the poison in the girl’s body. Soon after, Xiao Che felt a slight fluctuation in the girl’s chest and saw the girl slowly open her eyes... one by one....
She had a pair of exceptionally very black demonic-looking eyes that flashed mysteriously as she blinked. As Xiao Che met her eyes, he felt a horror equal to that of falling down a deep abyss... that gave his heart a fright! This girl who was extremely poisonous, without any breath, and had a deathly cold body... had now opened her eyes!
The girl reached out her right hand slowly and firmly seized Xiao Che’s left wrist when he was still in shock. She moved her lips and let out a voice.. the voice clearly said.....
"Sky... Poison... Pearl..."
Xiao Che’s quivered as if hit by an earthquake.. He could not believe his ears! Sky Poison Pearl was an object brought here by him from the Azure Cloud Continent, it did not exist in the Profound Sky Continent... but this girl had just said the name Sky Poison Pearl! Did he hear that wrong? Or was it just a coincidence?
"Little girl, you......ah!!"
Followed by the sound of Xiao Che’s sharp moaning pain, the girl opened her lips and firmly bit on his left finger.
Blood then started to stream down Xiao Che’s middle and index finger, all flowing into the girl’s mouth, without a drop on the ground. Alarmed, Xiao Che tried to pull his hand back... Although the girl’s little snow white hand looked delicate, her grip was as strong as iron as she bit him while holding his hand tight. Xiao Che had used his full strength but he was unable to withdraw his hand. His eyes gradually widened as he felt as if all the blood in his body flowed to his left hand by an irresistible force, to then end up being sucked into the girl’s mouth.
She’s... sucking my... blood!?
The girl closed her sinister dark eyes and sucked on his finger greedily, like an infant drinking milk.
Who was this girl...
This girl had obviously been poisoned to a deadly degree, yet she left him unable to break free of her grasp. After desperately trying to pry himself free many times, he finally gave up as he helplessly watched her suck his blood.
Xiao Che was already born with a weak body but after losing such a huge amount of blood, his head started to feel dizzy. As he wondered if his blood would be sucked dry by this unknown girl, the pain from his left hand finger suddenly disappeared, and the hand that tightly gripped his wrist had slowly loosened.
Xiao Che stepped back, looking at the perfect girl with a dark expression, who was just sucking his blood. But after a while, the girl didn’t do anything, just like when Xiao Che first saw her, she was just laying there with her eyes closed and no breathes.
Xiao Che took a few steps back and looked at the perfect girl with a dark expression on his face. Just now, the girl had been clearly sucking his blood but after a while, the girl did not move at all, looking just like the time Xiao Che first met her. She was just quietly lying there with her eyes closed, soundlessly and breathlessly.
Hu...........
A cold gust of night wind went by, brushing against Xiao Che’s back and the girl’s body. In the cold wind, the girl’s body scattered with the wind like mist, completely vanishing from sight, leaving only a broken white skirt, a pair of black princess shoes, and a red butterfly clip.
Xiao Che: "! ! ! !"
Disappeared!?
A weird sensation came from his left palm. His heart immediately shivered with an astonished expression. He then closed his eyes and spiritually moved his conscious into the space within the Sky Poison Pearl.
The green interspatial storage within the Sky Poison Pearl was suppose completely empty.
When he entered inside this time, he saw a quiet floating snow white jade body in front of him.
Xiao Che widened his eyes as he used his hand to cover his nose for the first time in his life.
This girl was that little girl who had sucked his blood. The only difference was that she had not a strand of thread on her body and her entirely naked body appeared in front of his eyes
Her eyes were closed tight and her snow-like face was tranquil. Her long bloody hair fell down, dancing by itself without the slightest breeze. Her skin were as tenderly smooth, moist, and as white as an infant’s, with delicate baby fat. The girl’s eyebrows were like emerald feathers, her waist was thin, and her legs were daintily straight, as if made of jade. Although she was young, her upper body had considerably matured. Her snow white breasts were like two jade pearls on her perfect body, as soft as the springtime shoots of bamboo. A beautiful breathtaking sight.
This was a body that was still not matured yet, but there was still the release of a stunning charm that would steal souls in her immaturity. It was as if all the beauty in the world had been mustered inside this body of ultimate perfection.
Xiao Che used his will to concentrate as hard as he could to move his eyes away from her body. He turned around while still clutching his nose. The instant he saw the girl’s body, he felt as if his blood would flow upwards. He believed that if he continued to watch her, his blood would definitely spurt out.
Why was she not wearing clothes...
No! That wasn’t the main point !!
She had clearly disappeared before so how did she suddenly appear inside his Sky Poison Pearl! The Sky Poison Pearl had fused with his body so I should be the only one who could control it. How could she appear in here without my command....
Was it... because she sucked my blood?
What the hell was going on?
Xiao Che’s brain became a total mess. Even with his two lifetime’s worth of academic experience, he was unable to understand what had happened.
Xiao Che withdrew his consciousness from the Sky Poison Pearl and picked up the girl’s clothes from the ground. He purified the poison on them before sending the clothes back into the Sky Poison Pearl, then quickly covered the girl’s body with them before letting out a small sigh of relief.
What kind of person was this girl really? Why did she appear here? Why did she suck his blood? How did she know about the Sky Poison Pearl? And how did she enter the Sky Poison Pearl?
Xiao Che could not think up of an answer for any of these questions.
He silently watched this girl for a long time and then stretched out a hand to lightly touch her upper lip. His fingertips immediately felt a tiny bit of warmth, a contrast to the earlier icy coldness. A weak breath could also be felt, evenly brushing against his fingertips.
These were all signs of life.
"Little sister?" Xiao Che called, shaking her body.
No matter what the time, a woman’s appearance was her strongest bargaining chip and most powerful weapon. If this girl wasn’t as beautiful as a fairy, but instead horrendously ugly to a point that one would throw up for three days with just a glance, Xiao Che would absolutely, without hesitation, kick her out from the Sky Poison Pearl. But this girl was not only thoroughly shrouded in mystery, but had also just then bit his finger and forcefully sucked his blood, causing his body to break out in a cold sweat. She even strangely appeared within the Sky Poison Pearl. However, when Xiao Che looked at her, rather than the previous sense of danger, he instead felt an undeniable sense of pity. This was because this girl was such a beauty, so beautiful that it was impossible for anyone to associate her with the word "danger".
Rather than a man’s natural instinct, it was more appropriate to say that this would be countless men’s most base of nature.
Xiao Che shouted for a long time, but the girl did not respond at all. He stepped back a few paces and then silently gazed at her.
This girl was definitely not normal... Xiao Che thought to himself. From the scars that were on her body, and her ripped up clothing, it was easy to see that the poison on her body wasn’t accidentally spilled, but rather forcefully applied by someone else. For this young girl, the most ordinary poison would have been enough to kill her, but her enemy instead used a poison so strong that it alarmed even him.
The person able to use this kind of poison was definitely a very frightening person.
What was even more frightening was that, even with her entire body covered in this poison, she still had not died yet!!
Then, what should he do with her? Should he just let her quietly sleep inside the Sky Poison Pearl?
Xiao Che pondered for a long time before silently leaving the Sky Poison Pearl, leaving the girl inside. Although this girl had just then sucked his blood, it seemed to be an unconscious behavior. A girl this beautiful, how could she possibly be evil? If he took a step back to think about it, at such a young age, how could she become a threat?
He also had no idea when she’ll wake up.
After purifying the poison on the ground to the best of his ability, Xiao Che started to leave. In the dead of night, he could only hear his own footsteps. When he was only about a hundred steps from the Xiao clan’s back wall, he suddenly saw a shadow walk directly towards him.
His footsteps suddenly stopped as he looked ahead... Who was sneaking out here this late?
The shadow in front of him also discovered him and stopped, vigilantly asking, "Who is it?"
This voice caused Xiao Che to immediately stare, involuntarily saying: "Little Aunt?"
"Ah?" The shadow let out a quiet gasp, then quickly ran over. Coming closer, the moonlight revealed a dainty but charmingly elegant cheek. It was precisely Xiao Lingxi. Upon clearly seeing Xiao Che, she opened her eyes wide. "Xiao Che? Why are you here?"
"I..." Xiao Che scratched his head. "I couldn’t sleep, so I came out to stargaze."
"Stargaze? Tonight is your wedding night, you aren’t with your Xia Qingyue consummating... consummating your marriage, but instead came out here to stargaze?!" Xiao Lingxi grabbed Xiao Che’s arm, an angry pout on her face. "Don’t you know that it’s dangerous here? From time to time, profound beasts will come out, and when it’s this dark, sometimes bandits will come here. What would happen if you carelessly ran into them? I have told you many times now, if I or your grandfather aren’t by your side, you absolutely can’t come out here, even if it’s during the day. You actually... did not listen to my words!"
As she talked, Xiao Lingxi also angrily pinched Xiao Che’s arm as punishment.
"Ah! It hurts, it hurts!" Xiao Che hurriedly yelled and then apologetically said, "Little aunt, I know I’m in the wrong, next time I definitely won’t dare."
"You want there to be a next time?!" Xiao Lingxi glared at him with her beautiful eyes.
"... There definitely won’t be a next time! If I want to come to the rear mountains in the future, I definitely will call for little aunt to come with me." Xiao Che solemnly vowed. With that said, if it weren’t for his extra life’s worth of memories, he definitely wouldn’t dare to come out to this place alone at night.
"That’s more like it... There’s not allowed to be a next time!"
"Then... Little aunt, why did you come here? It’s this late already." Xiao Che asked, confused.
"I..." Xiao Lingxi’s voice lowered, her eyes appearing a bit hollow. "I don’t know why, but I couldn’t sleep tonight. Then I saw that the stars were really bright tonight, so I wanted to come to the rear mountains to take a look."
Xiao Che looked up at the sky, then said with a smile, "In the past, little aunt and I would frequently sneak out here at night to enjoy the evening wind and look at the stars... And would frequently get caught and scolded by grandfather."
"Hm." Xiao Lingxi responded, then quietly said, "I also thought about that, so I thought I’d see how it felt to come out by myself to stargaze... Because in the future, I might not be able to stargaze with little Che."
"Ah? Why?"
"Stupid! Because little Che is married! In the future, you should be accompanying your wife, Qingyue, to bed at night, rather than coming out to enjoy the evening wind and stargaze." Xiao Lingxi coldly glanced at him and then pouted for some reason.
"That’s not true! As long as little aunt is willing, no matter when, I would willingly come here with little aunt to stargaze... See! Aren’t I doing that with you right now?" Xiao Che said with a smile.
"You’re still saying that! Sneaking to the rear mountains during your wedding night... Ah! You weren’t forced out here by Xia Qingyue, were you?" Upon thinking of that, Xiao Lingxi’s face filled with rage and she stamped her feet: "Hmph! That’s too excessive, I’m going to go find her!"
"You don’t need to worry about her." Xiao Che grabbed Xiao Lingxi’s hand. "I wasn’t forced out here by her. I came out by myself. Maybe I just carelessly predicted that I’d meet little aunt here... come on, let’s go to that place."
"Ah..."
Leading Xiao Lingxi by the hand, Xiao Che jogged through the cool evening wind towards that familiar place.
This was a small hilltop covered by soft and tender grass. Xiao Che and Xiao Lingxi leaned against each other shoulder to shoulder, bathing in the occasional evening wind, their hearts at peace.
"I thought that after little Che got married, I would lose a large part of you. Xia Qingyue is so beautiful, better than me in every aspect. I was afraid that once you had her, you would always stay at her side, leaving me with less and less time with you." Looking at the night sky, Xiao Lingxi’s eyes overflowed with a wavering light that was even brighter than the stars.
"Little aunt really didn’t believe my words at all." Xiao Che bitterly replied, "I clearly said this morning that in my heart, one hundred Xia Qingyue’s won’t compare to little aunt. Little aunt forced me... Er, wait no, promised with me. I firmly remember, and will definitely willingly comply..."
"After I marry Xia Qingyue, I won’t forget about little aunt just because I have a wife. I’ll spend the same amount of time with little aunt like before, I will listen to little aunt’s calls and would arrive as soon as I’m called just like before. And lastly, although Xia Qingyue is now my wife, in my heart, she definitely won’t outweigh little aunt... I guarantee that I remembered every word right!"
"..." Xiao Lingxi had a dumbfounded expression on her face and the look in her eyes blurred. "I know that was a bit excessive. I was just... just playing around. You really kept it in your heart all along?"
"Of course." Xiao Che nodded without hesitation. "Because little aunt and grandfather are the most important people in my life. Other people can’t compare. Little aunt, I promise you, even though I’m now married, you won’t ever lose me, just like I hope to never lose you."
"Hehe..." Xiao Lingxi happily smiled, her hands hugging Xiao Che’s arm. She rested her head on his shoulder. "As expected, my little Che is the most well behaved, most obedient."
A dark cloud floated through the sky, temporarily blocking the full moon, immediately dimming the surrounding lighting.
"Now that I think about it, it’s been a long time... no, it seems like it’s been quite a few months since we came out here to stargaze together. When we were little, whether it was winter or summer, we would frequently sneak out here. I remember one winter night, at this very spot, of course the sky was filled with many stars. We watched for a long time, then accidentally fell asleep against each other... Turns out that it unexpected snowed that night, and we were frozen while sleeping. When father found us, we had already become two little snowmen. Afterwards, we only recovered after staying next to the stove for two days and drinking a lot of bitter medicine. Father was really angry, but was reluctant to spank me, not to mention you. So after we got better, he made us shovel a large patch of snow as punishment."
Xiao Che continued with a smile, "And then, we only shoveled for a bit before we started playing in the snow. We even made a big snowman that really looked like grandfather. He didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry. Once he started laughing, he completely forgot about our punishment."
"Uh huh! Father was always like that. He usually looks really fierce, but he could never bring himself to spank us even once and would only put on a show to scare us. No matter what, as long as we threw even a small tantrum, he would obediently listen to us." Xiao Lingxi’s face was full of warm laughter.
"One time wasn’t like that." Xiao Che’s smile became vague. "On my twelfth birthday, when you were eleven, grandfather got you a small courtyard, and forbid you from sleeping together with me in the future. I remember you would beg Grandfather every day, crying and shouting, and even angrily stopped eating. But grandfather was extremely unyielding. No matter what he wouldn’t let you sleep in the same bed with me... as time passed by, you could only obediently follow his order."
"That... That’s because I was really young, and had a lot of things that I didn’t understand!" Xiao Lingxi lightly pinched Xiao Che’s shoulder. "Some girl things I only learned after growing up, hmph."
"What things?" Xiao Che widely opened his eyes, his face full of suspicion.
"That... That boys and girls can’t sleep together after they grow up! I can’t believe you didn’t know!" Thinking about what had happened before, Xiao Lingxi added another sentence: "Also, they can’t randomly kiss like when they were little!"
"Ah, so it’s like that..." Xiao Che glanced at Xiao Lingxi lovely cheek, dyed jade under the bright and beautiful starlight. He quietly leaned closer: "But, I always want to kiss you, what should I do?"
"Then marry me!" Xiao Lingxi replied with a proud face, her pink cheeks raising slightly,
"If you weren’t my little aunt, I would definitely marry you," Xiao Che said without thinking.
"..."
After saying that, Xiao Che immediately stared blankly ahead. Xiao Lingxi’s expression also froze as she vacantly stared at him... as if they had both been struck dumb.
"Um... Little aunt, why are you looking at me with such a strange expression?" Suddenly realizing that the atmosphere had become a bit awkward, Xiao Che held his breath for a while before cautiously asking.
Only then did Xiao Lingxi’s beautiful eyes, which had a dazed look for a long time, tremble slightly. She hastily wrested her gaze away and lowered her head, softly spitting out: "Aren’t you afraid that your wife Qingyue will hear those words that you said just now?"
Xiao Che put on a show of looking around, and then innocently said: "It doesn’t seem like there’s anyone around us, so what are you afraid of? But even if she did hear me, I still don’t have anything to fear. You did not know that she actually doesn’t sincerely want to marry me, and I also do not really want to be married to her. If it was little aunt though, I..."
"Don’t talk... Don’t keep talking!"
Xiao Lingxi reached out her hand and forcefully pressed them against his lips, firmly sealing his next words. Only after a long time did she release him, once again resting her body against Xiao Che’s shoulder, peacefully saying: "Little Che, even though I’m younger than you by a year, I am truly, without a doubt, your little aunt. There are some words that you can say to other girls, that you can not say to me... In this lifetime... you can not say them... I know in your heart, you really think like this... but that’s enough..."
At the last two sentences, Xiao Lingxi’s voice had become very, very quiet. Within her muttering contained a sense of bitterness and sadness that would break the heart of anyone listening.
Xiao Che’s heart also heavily shook. He didn’t say anything else, closed his eyes, and peacefully listened to the breathing and heartbeat of the girl beside him.
"When I was young, I was thin, dark, and short. Everyone called me an ugly duckling and always made fun of me, bullied me..." Xiao Lingxi snuggled against him, a dreamy voice escaping from her mouth: "Only you would play with me. When someone bullied me, little Che would always rush up to fight with them and chase them away. You were always covered in cuts and bruises... The injuries you received at that time were all because of me. I got used to, and also enjoyed the feeling of little Che’s protection. I believed that you would always be able to protect me this way..."
Xiao Lingxi’s words reminded Xiao Che of the younger Xiao Lingxi. At that time, she truly was thin, dark, and short as she had just described, in every sense an "ugly duckling". But because she was his little aunt, as a man, and also because he was older than her by a year, he would always, as if it was his mission, protect her with all his might...Who could have thought that this young woman would become very different from the little girl she once was. The once ugly duckling had transformed into today’s beauty. Who knows how many young men of the Xiao Clan would watered at the mouth while longing for her.
(TL: Idiom – "this girl changed eighteen times between childhood and her coming of age")
"Afterwards, little Che found out that his profound veins were deformed. I started to bitterly cultivate my profound strength right away... because it was my turn to protect little Che. At that time, I thought whether it was little Che protecting me, or me protecting little Che, it was all one and the same. Either way we could be together... It wasn’t until I slowly grew up that I understood. That little Che would find a wife, and that I would also have to get married. By that time, we absolutely could not be as we were before... In addition, out of all the girls in the world, the only one little Che could not marry was me... Out of all the boys in the world, the only one that I could not marry was little Che..."
Xiao Che: "......"
"After such a long time, I thought I had already completely accepted it. Today little Che got married. I should be really happy, but from morning to evening, it was like something had been stuffed in my heart. It was an indescribable pain. When I wanted to sleep, I couldn’t fall asleep, no matter what I did... And little Che, when you said those kinds of words to me... I was somewhat happy, yet also really sad... What has happened to me?"
Xiao Che’s stomach heavily lurched. While he still had not spoken at this time, he also had no idea what he should say.
The dangerously hazy feeling between him and Xiao Lingxi was born a long time ago. When they became conscious of these kinds of dangerous, forbidden feelings, they still stayed together night and day, but never had even a bit of honest conversation about it. Rather, in their hearts, they blamed it on familial affection.
The him without the lifetime of memories from Azure Cloud Continent had a cowardly and self-abased personality. Even until death, he would only try to escape the words that were impossible for him to say it out loud. Until those kinds of feelings were completely buried. Xiao Lingxi... had not revealed her feelings, before today, even once. But the Xiao Che of today was not the Xiao Che from yesterday and he said those earth shattering words. In response, the indecisive Xiao Lingxi, at this isolated rear mountain hilltop in the depth of night, had let out her insuppressible feelings that she was forbidden to say.
Xiao Che’s heart began to beat at an erratic pace. As he inhaled this enrapturing girl’s fragrance, he extended his right arm, lightly embracing Xiao Lingxi’s body. Xiao Lingxi’s body quivered slightly, but did not resist. She closed her eyes, quietly nestling on top of him with her entire body weight.
The girl’s lovely body was soft, as if without bones, was like warm, fragrant and soft jade. Her tender and satiny skin, though separated by a few layers of clothing, could still cause a person’s soul shake. Xiao Che did not dare to embrace her too strongly, afraid that he would carelessly frighten or hurt her. However, immediately, he felt a pair of jade like arms stealthily wrap around his back, taking the initiative to hold him closer and closer. A gust of faint, aromatic scent from an unknown place also entered his nose and then continued deep into his heart.
Xiao Lingxi’s willingness dissolved the hesitation in Xiao Che’s heart. He extended his left arm to embrace her slender waist, but his mind suddenly froze. His arm’s destination had accidentally changed. Upon landing, the feeling of a soft and warm lump was transmitted to his hand.
"Ah...."
Xiao Lingxi’s mouth let out a moan. Xiao Che’s mind was a mess. He immediately wanted to remove his hand, but Xiao Lingxi’s soft, jade arm rested on top of the hand that had grabbed her first. At first, Xiao Che thought she wanted to swat away the hand that had accidentally violated her, but... her jade like hand only grasped his palm and rested there, not moving away, but not allowing him to flail about. Between these proudly towering breasts, Xiao Che still could clearly feel her wild heartbeat.
The sound of Xiao Lingxi’s breath was rough and heavy. A blush had long ago extended from her face to her snow colored jade neck. She tightly closed her eyes and burrowed her head against his chest, completely motionless, as if trying hard to prove that she had already fallen asleep.
Xiao Che also closed his eyes, completely still and completely silent, the two of them peacefully cuddling against each other. At this point, neither of them were willing to talk... for that would break this completely undisturbed dream.
The night had grown deeper. When Xia Qingyue found them, they were still the same position, but had fallen into a deep sleep.
Xia Qingyue had come out to look for Xiao Che. She originally thought he had just left to take a breath of fresh air. While he was out "taking a breath of fresh air", she had also left the bed and laid out the blanket in that corner so that he could safely sleep there upon his return. But after waiting a long time, he still had not come back.
Instead, from the direction of the earlier sounds, he seemed to have climbed over the wall toward the Xiao clan’s rear mountains.
With his weak profound strength at only the first level of the Elementary Profound Realm, he had gone to the rear mountains, for such a long time without coming back, in the middle of the night... Xia Qingyue finally was unable to hold back and came out to look for him. Thus, letting her witness this scene before her, that caused her to stare dumbfoundedly.
Today was her and Xiao Che’s first day as a married couple. When he picked her up on the road to the Xiao clan, his tranquil attitude contained proudness. In the assembly hall, he held back his anger and hatred. In the bridal chamber, though he said all kinds of things and had a vulgar mouth, his expression and the look in his eyes unceasingly swayed fascinatingly between confusion, unwillingness and despondence. There was even a desolate loneliness that even she could not understand....
But now, the him nestled together with Xiao Lingxi was sleeping with incomparable steadiness. The corner of his mouth was raised very slightly, clearly revealing a warm smile. His five sense were completely relaxed, his expression loose, tranquil and peaceful like a baby sleeping in his mother’s bosom.
Suddenly, an uncomfortable feeling floated up in Xia Qingyue’s heart... of course, this didn’t mean that she had any feelings towards Xiao Che. But she and Xiao Che had become a married couple. She had always believed that this marriage was just a formality for her, that the status as husband or wife were also mere titles, and that nothing could cause even the slightest ripple in her heart. However, in some things, the heart does not always follow a person’s expectation. This was especially true for women, who, unless they had no heart, were more prone to sentimentality.
After all, she and Xiao Che were already husband and wife. Although, in her thoughts, she didn’t care at all about this kind of union but the fact that Xiao Che was now her husband would still be distinctly imprinted in her subconscious. Since he was her husband, he should rightfully belong only to her. Instead, on his wedding night, he had cuddled with another woman until they had both fallen asleep, with such a warm and content expression on his face... Her subconscious naturally would raise that kind of unfamiliar reaction.
Even if the girl was his little aunt.
This kind of uncomfortable feeling caused her usually tranquil and frozen fairy-like heart to twinge slightly. This sense of irritation allowed her to immediately wake up from her reverie, and quickly focus all her attention to still her heart. After a long while, the prickly feeling gradually disappeared and her heart had already completely cleared.
She did not disturb Xiao Che and Xiao Lingxi and, with light footsteps, left without a sound.
After a short while, Xia Qingyue unhurriedly returned, with a crimson blanket in her arms. She carefully laid the blanket on top of Xiao Che and Xiao Lingxi’s bodies and once again left without a sound.
........................
When Xiao Che woke up, it was already dawn. Nestled against his chest, Xiao Lingxi was still sleeping soundly, her sleeping posture charmingly sweet... if one ignored the large glob of saliva on his chest.
His sleep fogged mind gradually cleared up, and bit by bit, last night’s scene replayed in Xiao Che’s head. Though his shoulder was numb and sore after an entire night, he didn’t dare move even a little as to not disturb Xiao Lingxi’s peaceful sleep. It was also at this time that he suddenly discovered the crimson blanket covering his body.
"Well... f*ck..." As he raised his hand to grab the blanket, a low, uncontrollable roar spewed out of Xiao Che’s mouth... This clearly was the blanket that was just prepared yesterday, and had been laid out on the bridal chamber bed.
Xiao Che looked up in the direction of his own courtyard, his heart letting loose a groan... On the wedding night, not only was he not in the bridal chamber, but had also went out and slept with another woman, all night. His newly wed wife had also personally run over to deliver a blanket.
This scenario... was truly thrilling!
It was early morning. The sky had barely begun to brighten when the master of the Xiao Clan, Xiao Yunhai, was woken from his deep sleep by the sound of urgent knocking on his door. "Clan master! Clan master, are you awake?"
Xiao Yunhai opened his eyes, took a glance at the light outside and then asked, with a frown: "This early in the morning, what happened?"
"It’s... it’s the Xiao... Xiao Sect! A letter from the Xiao Sect!" From outside the door came this excited, trembling voice.
"What? The Xiao Sect?!"
This master of the Xiao Clan, one of the most powerful people in Floating Cloud City, sprung up from his bed as if stabbed by a dagger on the butt. He haphazardly threw on his clothes and, not even bothering to straighten his hair, threw open the door hastily, grabbing the Xiao Clan disciple that was outside. He bellowed with wide eyes: "You said the Xiao Sect? The Xiao Sect?!"
"Yes! It’s definitely the Xiao Sect!" That Xiao Clan disciple swallowed with great difficulty, nodded with all his strength, and then presented the letter in his hand to Xiao Yunhai. "This letter has the eagle seal of the Xiao Sect! In this Blue Wind Empire, no one would dare to forge the Xiao Sect’s insignia."
As soon as he saw the sky hawk seal on the letter, Xiao Yunhai’s entire body shook. He fiercely grabbed the letter, then, with violently shaking hands, quickly but carefully tore it open to reveal the paper within.
Although the Xiao Sect’s name had only one word of difference if compared to his Xiao Clan, that one word was like the difference between the clouds and mud! The Xiao Clan barely counted as the leading presence in Floating Cloud City, but on the Profound Sky Continent as a whole, it was simply a nameless existence. However the Xiao Sect is one of the four strongest sects in the Blue Wind Empire! They have the same level of prestige as the Heavenly Sword Villa, Frozen Cloud Asgard, and the Burning Heaven Clan. They were an existence that the Xiao Clan could not even hope to look up to.
To put it bluntly, a useless servant in the Xiao Sect would not even find it necessary to respect the Xiao Clan’s master.
However, there was a connection between the Xiao Clan and the Xiao Sect. That is because the person that founded Floating Cloud City’s Xiao Clan one hundred and sixty years ago, Xiao Bieli, was at the time a person from the Xiao Sect... To be more precise, he was an abandoned disciple, and, as rumor had it, the son of one of the elders at the time. However, Xiao Bieli was the result of that elder raping one of the Xiao Sect’s serving girls while drunk. Since childhood, his appearance was ordinary and his talent was lacking. Furthermore he attracted a large amount of gossip, causing that elder a great amount of displeasure. Upon reaching adulthood, his profound strength was the lowest among all of his peers. To let him remain at the Xiao Sect would only cause that elder more humiliation so he found an opportunity to send him to that piece of shit place, the rural Floating Cloud City and helped him establish the Xiao Clan. From then on he paid no more attention to Xiao Bieli and cut off all contact between them and the Xiao Sect.
But Xiao Bieli nevertheless was born in the proud Xiao Sect. He spent his entire life painstakingly cultivating his profound strength, hoping to gain recognition, and thus one day earn their approval and one day return to Xiao Sect. After he died, this desire was passed down through the Xiao Clan from one generation to the next, and became ultimate goal of every generation of the Xiao Clan. Especially among each generation’s clan master, all without exception hoped that they could rely on the tiny bit of Xiao Sect blood in them to establish a relationship, no matter how fragile, with the Xiao Sect. But after all these years, the Xiao Clan never produced a person that could fulfill this wish. Talk of the Xiao Sect to them was like that of the Celestial Palace, something that they couldn’t even hope to reach.
However, today, the Xiao Sect had taken the initiative to send a letter! This couldn’t fail to send Xiao Yunhai into joyful hysteria, the excitement making him feel as if he was in a dream.
After reading the letter’s contents word by word, Xiao Yunhai’s face was completely red, his breathing erratic. He pointed a trembling finger outside, hoarsely saying: "Quickly... quickly inform the elders to immediately gather at the main hall! Tell them we need to discuss big news concerning the future of our Xiao Clan... Go quick!"
"Ah... Yes!" The Xiao Clan disciple immediately answered and ran off in a panic.
......................................................
Xiao Che carefully opened the door, crimson blanket in hand, only to find that Xia Qingyue was already sitting beside the bed, awake and dressed. Her beautiful eyes that were as calm as water, watched him without even a tiny ripple.
Xiao Che immediately tossed the blanket on the table. With a face not red and a heart not racing, he calmly asked: "Wife, you’re up so early. Did you sleep well last night?"
"You’re not going to first tell me where you went last night?" Xia Qingyue faintly asked, her beautiful eyes narrowing slightly.
"No need." Xiao Che stretched his body and then started to straighten his hair using the mirror: "Because I know you definitely aren’t interested."
Xia Qingyue: "......"
Although he fell asleep at the rear mountains with Xiao Lingxi last night, when he woke up, his mood was unusually good. After he straightened out his clothes and hair slightly, returning to his pretty boy image. Xiao Che stood up to leave and said: "Let’s go. It’s the morning of the first day, we have to go pay our respects to grandfather... This you won’t refuse, right?"
Xia Qingyue stood without a word and stepped out of the door ahead of him. Xiao Che loosened his shoulders and quickly followed her out.
Xiao Lie woke up early every day, and today was no exception. Upon entering Xiao Lie’s courtyard, the first thing they saw was him watering his flowers and plants. As he saw Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue enter, he gently smiled. "You came."
Under Xiao Lie’s attentive gaze, Xiao Che quickly reached out and held Xia Qingyue’s small hand in his own. Xiao Qingyue’s hand was soft and smooth, yet also cool to the touch, perhaps because she was trained in the Frozen Cloud Arts. Xia Qingyue’s entire body stiffened. Right before she was about to yank her hand free from Xiao Che, she noticed Xiao Lie’s gaze, and had no choice but to quietly tolerate it. She let Xiao Che walk to Xiao Lie with her, hand in hand.
Her father was always very respectful towards Xiao Lie and she was no different. In front of just Xiao Che, she could show him not a single bit of affection, but if she were to shake off Xiao Che’s hand in front of Xia Lie, then she can only imagine how ugly his face would become.
This despicable scoundrel...
"Grandfather, you’re up so early today again." Xiao Che led Xiao Qingyue over and naturally greeted Xiao Li with the courtesy of a junior.
"Qingyue pays her respects to grandfather." Qingyue lightly curtsied, her posture gentle and dignified. The fact that it was her first time being led by the hand, and used by such underhanded methods, left her both angry and helpless. If it weren’t for the fact that her profound strength would be detected by this elderly man at the apex of the Spirit Profound Realm, she would have definitely used the Frozen Cloud Arts to freeze Xiao Che until he grimaced.
"Haha, you two also woke up very early." Seeing Xiao Che and Xiao Qingyue’s intimate appearance, Xiao Che’s face revealed a cheerful expression. "Che Er, Qingyue, even though the age of sixteen is a bit early to get married, it also set a part of my heart at ease. Qingyue, you should already know about Che Er’s condition. Frankly speaking, this wedding honestly was not fair to you. But our family will spare no expense to make it up to you. Right now, my greatest wish is to see the two of you peacefully live your lives."
Xia Qingyue had not managed to reply before Xiao Che hurriedly said: "Grandfather, don’t say that! I, Xiao Che, am your grandson. There isn’t a woman under heaven that I’m not fit for. Where did we wrong her? After joining the family, of course she’d come pay her respects to grandfather and then carefully take care of me as the days pass. If she doesn’t do it right, then I’ll divorce her and find a better wife. Don’t you agree, Qingyue my wife?"
"..." If it weren’t for the fact that Xiao Lie was standing right in front of them, Xia Qingyue would definitely have forever frozen Xiao Che’s mouth shut with a gust of the Frozen Cloud Fairy’s Secret Arts.
"Hahahaha." Xiao Lie burst into laughter, helplessly shaking his head. He looked at Xiao Che with a pampering look: "Oh you, Qingyue had only just joined the family and you’re already bullying her like this. Qingyue, don’t listen to his nonsense. Che Er, this brat, hasn’t had a honest mouth since he was young. You two should not have eaten this early right? Knowing that the two of you would come, old Hong already had the kitchen send over breakfast. Come, let’s eat together."
"Yes grandfather... That’s right, should we call for little aunt to come as well?"
"She had always loved to sleep since she was young. Since it’s still early, let’s not bother her."
The dining table inside the house was indeed already ladened with three just-cooked portions of breakfast. Xiao Che never let go of her hand and dragged Xia Qingyue, who was with great efforts trying to look natural, to sit shoulder by shoulder on one side of the table. Xiao Lie began to take his seat opposite them. He had only touched his his seat when the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside, accompanied by a coarse voice:
"Fifth Elder! Is the Fifth Elder here?"
"What is it?" Xiao Lie stood up and slightly wrinkled his brow.
"Clan... Clan master’s order. All elders are to immediately go to the main hall to discuss news concerning the future of the Xiao Clan. You must immediately go!"
"..." Xiao Lie stood up, grabbed the jacket offered to him by Xiao Hong and then spoke to Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue: "Looks like it’s an emergency. You two eat first. There’s no need to wait for me."
There wasn’t a single time in Xiao Lie’s memory where an such urgent summon came so early in the morning. He draped his jacket over his body, then quickly left.
Xiao Lie had only just left, but Xiao Che’s hand left Xia Qingyue’s as fast as lightning. His body also jumped backwards with a *woosh* as his eyebrows slanted slightly. He said with a grim face, "Qingyue my wife, you are very clever, so you should definitely understand that the reason I held your hand was to give grandfather some peace of mind. I definitely don’t have any other intentions. Even though I didn’t get your approval beforehand, you definitely wouldn’t lash out in anger, right?"
Xia Qingyue’s expression had indeed become a bit icy. She coldly spoke: "If you dare to randomly touch my body again, then I won’t be this polite anymore."
"Hey! You wouldn’t go that far, right?!" Xiao Che watched her with wide eyes and a depressed look on his face. "I only held your hand and you’re already so angry... We are still a genuine couple. Even if you’re only married me to repay a debt of gratitude, we’re still husband and wife. Since we’re a married couple, it’s normal for me to touch everywhere, not to mention the hand... No, rather, that’s how it’s supposed to be! You’ve been married to me less than a day and yet have always been cold and indifferent. You wouldn’t even let me sleep on the same bed on the wedding night. Now even holding your hand causes you to get so angry... *Sobs* What kind of wife did I marry? It’s practically even worse than taking an empress for a wife..."
"..." Xia Che’s temperament was more and more giving Xia Qingyue a feeling of helplessness. The first time she saw him, she felt that he was cold and proud. Gradually, she also felt that his disposition was not ordinary, and even held a touch of mystery. Many times, he gave her the feeling that this wasn’t in fact a sixteen year old, but rather an adult man with many years of experience... Save for his uncouth nature that would be revealed whenever he wasn’t careful.
And now, even though he clearly had shamelessly violated her, he still acted as if he had done no wrong. Instead, like a little brat, he brazenly complained, firmly turning her from the victim to the villain. For a moment, she was dumbfounded and didn’t know whether she should laugh or cry. Even the anger in her chest had unwittingly dissipated by a large amount.
"Forget it, let’s sit and eat." Xia Qingyue said powerlessly.
"In other words, my wife Qingyue isn’t angry anymore? He he, that’s more like an obedient wife. Come, let’s eat a lot!" Xiao Che immediately climbed across the table and then sat back down, next to Xia Qingyue, passing the green bean cake on his plate to hers.
"......" Xia Qingyue began to suspect that the request she had made to her teacher to stay by his side for one month was both an erroneous and dangerous decision.
Only after Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue finished eating breakfast did Xiao Lie return, an unprecedentedly heavy look written on his face, along with a bit of shock that had yet to completely disperse.
"Grandfather, what happened?" Xiao Che promptly stood up and asked.
"A major event. For the Xiao Clan, this is an enormous matter." Xiao Lie said, yet his furrowed brow loosened. "But, it shouldn’t have much to do with us."
"An enormous matter? What kind of matter is it?" Xiao Che was even more astonished.
"It’s the Xiao Sect."
"The Xiao Sect?" This time, not only Xiao Che, but even Xia Qingyue raised an eyebrow.
"About half an hour ago, the clan master received a letter from the Xiao Sect. The letter said that the Xiao Sect will immediately send a group of people here. Not only that, but the leader of that group is the Xiao Sect’s current Sect Master Xiao Juetian’s youngest son!" Xiao Lie said slowly.
"..." This news caused Xiao Che to fall quiet for a long while before saying: "If that’s true, then something doesn’t make sense. While our Xiao Clan did come from the Xiao Sect one hundred and sixty years ago, the Xiao Sect has always treated us with contemptuous disgust. With more than one hundred years of separation, there couldn’t be anyone in the Xiao Sect that would care about our tiny Xiao Clan. Why would they suddenly send people here? But to say that they’re plotting something... the Xiao Sect’s influence covers the sky, why would they need to plot against us? To say that they’re granting us a favor, is even more impossible."
Xiao Lie shook his head and said: "Of course there’s a reason. Our Xiao Clan’s founding ancestor, Xiao Bieli, was secretly expelled from the Xiao Sect because his talent was just too poor, but his father was, at the time, the Xiao Sect’s Enforcement Hall’s elder, Xiao Zheng. Not long ago, Xiao Zheng died. In the year before he died, his thoughts no longer were of chasing power and fame, but rather that he still had Xiao Bieli as a son. After one hundred years without contact, his heart was ashamed. He left behind a dying wish, hoping that the Xiao Sect could, after his death, find Xiao Bieli’s descendents and from their youth select the most talented candidate to take back to the Xiao Sect to cultivate. This also serves as an apology for the disregard that he had shown Xiao Bieli and the subsequent expulsion."
An ordinary person can’t live to be over a hundred. But when one’s profound strength reaches a certain point, living for a few hundred years wasn’t out of the question. It’s said that once one breaks through to the Emperor Profound Realm, their life expectancy would span thousands of years. After listening to Xiao Lie’s words, Xiao Che first pondered and then felt relieved. No wonder the Xiao Sect would suddenly voluntarily send people to visit. Turns out it was this kind of thing. It seemed that the deceased Xiao Zheng still had some status among the Xiao Sect, so the Xiao Sect honored his final wish. He also realized why Xiao Lie said that this had nothing to do with them. "Select the most talented candidate to take back to the Xiao Sect to cultivate"... There was no way this most talented candidate any relation with Xiao Che.
However, it was obvious that the inner thoughts of the other elders, after hearing this news, should be surging greatly. To be taken back to the Xiao Sect to cultivate? What kind of idea was that? If any of their sons or grandsons were picked and taken back to the Xiao Sect, then it would be like an earthworm rising from the mud to become a golden dragon floating between the clouds overnight! All of their relatives would take take flight behind them. They would be able to arrogantly walk without fear of consequence not only among the Xiao Clan, but among all of Floating Cloud City. Anyone who dares to disagree, if told "Xiao Sect" those two words, even the city governor wouldn’t dare to talk back.
(TL: Literally means "wouldn’t dare to fart half a fart", this obviously doesn’t translate well.)
Xiao Lie’s expression looked to be truly peaceful, but the disappointment that was hidden with great effort still couldn’t escape Xiao Che’s eyes. Within the Xiao Clan, there wasn’t anyone who didn’t have the desire to go to the Xiao Sect. Even the him of today was like this. And with the Xiao Sect coming there, this was no doubt the best opportunity to get close to them, because now was when they can directly interact with the Xiao Sect’s people. The other Xiao Clan members all possess that sliver of hope. Only Xiao Lie did not even dare to hope, because there’s no way that Xiao Che would be the person that the Xiao Sect would pick.
Xiao Che opened his mouth to say something to comfort his Grandfather, but after mulling for a long time, he couldn’t think of a single word to say. His profound veins’ condition was clearly well-known. Even if he said something pleasing to the ears, what was the use?
"Even though this does not have anything to do with us, that can also be a good thing. The Xiao Sect is as large as the sky. Even if we did go there, we’d be among the lowest ranked people. How can it compare to freely and peacefully being on top in Floating Cloud City?" Xiao Lie easily laughed, sitting at the dining table: "Come, help your grandfather finish breakfast."
..........................................
After coming out of Xiao Lie’s courtyard, Xiao Che immediately realized that the entire Xiao Clan’s atmosphere had distinctively changed. Normally at this time, there would be quite a few people doing their morning training. However, now, as far as the eye can see, there were only scattered shadows, most of them moving with hurried footsteps and faces full of excitement.
"It looks like everyone thinks they can climb onto the high branch that is the Xiao Sect, but is leaping to the heavens in one step really a good thing? No one is thinking about what would happen if they truly did enter the Xiao Sect. I’d guess that they’d just be the lowliest of messengers." Xiao Che said cynically.
"Jealous?" Xia Qingyue expressionlessly asked.
"Definitely not!" As soon as he said that, Xiao Che realized that the Xia Qingyue by his side was a disciple of the Frozen Cloud Asgard, and in no way inferior to the Xiao Sect. He only curled his lips and said: "You aren’t the same as them... Forget it, pretend like I didn’t say anything."
Xia Qingyue no longer minded him and stepped forward. Although it was a really slow step, her body still moved seven or eight body widths away. Another step, and she was even further from Xiao Che, leaving him behind. Xiao Che’s footsteps stopped, entirely focusing on this gracefully stepping, phantom-like Xia Qingyue. He muttered, "Don’t tell me this is the legendary Frozen Cloud Asgard’s ‘Frozen Snow Dance Steps’? This woman’s profound strength was not that simple, it should not merely be at the Elementary Profound Realm’s tenth level."
"Yo! If it isn’t Brother Xiao Che!"
A voice called from the right. Xiao Che turned his head and saw Xiao Yang walking towards him. This Xiao Yang normally had his nose pointing at the sky in front of him and treated him with complete disdain. For him to voluntarily greet him was definitely an unusual first time.
"Brother Xiao Yang. You’re up early." Xiao Che turned towards him and greeted good-naturedly.
"What a coincidence, I was just about to go look for you, but who knew that I’d run into you here." Xiao Yang walked over while laughing.
"Brother Xiao Yang needed to find me for something?" Xiao Che asked, his face full of astonishment.
"Mmhmm," Xiao Yang nodded. "It’s actually Big Brother Yulong who had me come call you. He said that you’re the youngest among us, but the first to get married. As your fellow clanmate, he wanted to hold a little celebration for you, no matter what . Plus, there were too many people at the wedding yesterday, so it was hard to enjoy the wine. It’s best to drink a little and eat a little this morning, how about it? Do you have time?"
Inviting him to drink this early in the morning, it turns out that Xiao Yulong’s patience was really only just average. Xiao Che’s sneered in his heart. He was perfectly aware of the reason why Xiao Yulong came to find him. At that moment, his face revealed an overwhelmed expression, and he emotionally replied: "Is it really Brother Yulong calling for me? Of course! Of course there’s time! Since it’s Brother Yulong calling for me, how could I not have time? Then... do we go now?"
Xiao Che’s expression caused Xiao Yang to secretly sneer in disdain. He nodded: "Of course, let’s go."
Xiao Yulong’s courtyard was bigger than Xiao Che’s by about four or five times. Not only was it overwhelmingly luxurious, but it also had a dedicated serving girl.
Slightly north of the courtyard center sat a square pavilion, the table inside was ladened with food and wine. Xiao Yulong raised a wine cup with a warm smile on his face: "Little Brother Xiao Che, you married our Floating Cloud City’s number one jewel. Once again, I congratulate you. As your big brother, I’ll have to try harder from now on."
"Thank you Brother Yulong." Xiao Che also hurried raised his wine cup, his face red from excitement. "Actually... regarding that, my marriage is not a big deal at all. Really, if should be me congratulating Brother Yulong."
"Oh?" Xiao Yulong’s face revealed his suspicion. He asked with a smile, "Congratulating me? I don’t understand."
Xiao Che replied with a serious face, "It can’t be that Brother Yulong doesn’t know about the group coming from the Xiao Sect whom will select one the most talented youth to take back with them? In this generation of our Xiao Clan, as far as talent, position, looks, and character, who could compare with Brother Yulong? So this time, Brother Yulong will definitely be the one taken back to the Xiao Sect. It’s an enormously happy event."
"Right! That’s right, Brother Yulong will definitely be selected to go to the Xiao Sect this time! With big brother here, other people shouldn’t even think about it," Xiao Yang also promptly said. His aptitude within the Xiao clan was only middling high. On this matter, knowing his chances, he didn’t dare to have any ideas. The person with the best chance in the Xiao Clan was none other than Xiao Yulong. Since he had spent the last few years following Xiao Yulong around, if Xiao Yulong enters the Xiao Sect, it could only benefit him. He began to feel that these few years spent fawning on Xiao Yulong was indeed the right decision.
Wearing a modest expression, Xiao Yulong shook his head: "You guys praise me too much. Our Xiao Clan has many outstanding brothers and sisters. While I can be considered the best as far as profound strength goes, when it comes down to my qualification, I can’t say for certain. But I will try my best for this. Come, Brother Xiao Che, a toast to yesterday’s happiness."
While his words were very carefree, hidden in the depths of Xiao Yulong’s eyes was a glowing fanaticism greater than anyone else’s.
After downing a cup of wine, Xiao Che’s face flushed. At this time, Xiao Yang drew his face close, and asked with a face full of smiles: "Brother Xiao Che, the woman you married yesterday is truly the most beautiful woman in our Floating Cloud City. Your luck with women is the envy of all of us brothers. The taste from the bridal chamber last night... heh heh, must be equally pleasurable right?"
Xiao Yulong raised his wine cup, a smiling expression on his face but his gaze was dead set on Xiao Che’s face and eyes, prepared to see what expression he would reveal. However, as soon as Xiao Yang finished his question, Xiao Che’s eyes glowed brightly, his face revealing a wanton smile understandable by all men. He leaned his head closer to Xiao Yang and lowered his voice, smiling: "Absolutely! Heh heh heh heh... Brother Xiao Yang, I’ll let you know, all women are the same. Xia Qingyue normally looks like a proud peacock, but in bed, she’s an absolute slut. Ah, her moaning, her flavor, definitely was pleasurable! Heh heh heh heh..."
Xiao Che narrowed his eyes as he talked, his entire face red with intoxication.
*Ping*.....
The wine cup in Xiao Yulong’s hand was crushed into pieces, scattering all over the table.
